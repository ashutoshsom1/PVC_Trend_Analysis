MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
INDUSTRY STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES, THREATS, RISKS, CONCERNS AND OUTLOOK:-
The Indian economy started the ˜scal year 2018-19 with a healthy eight per cent growth in the June 
 
2018 quarter,however India's real gross domestic product growth dropped to a ˜ve-year low of seven per cent 
in 2018-2019. The slowdown in the Indian economy emanated from sectors like housing, agriculture, auto, 

manufacturing and trade, and services etc.
The priority to revive economic growth against the persistent high ˜scal de˜cit, ˚attening tax revenues, failure 
of business models in some of the sector such as infrastructure, agriculture are key challenges for the government
Plastic Division

The
 
Plastic Business
 
has achieved a volume growth of 7% and value growth of 13%. During the Financial Year 
2018-19 it has achieved total turnover of 
`
 
2093 Cr. as compared to 
` 
1856 Cr. in the previous year.
Furniture Business
 
recorded a growth of 12% in value terms over the previous year. This business focuses 
on 3 major verticals i.e. Moulded Furniture, Ready Furniture and Mattress, a combination which by itself is a 
unique business model leveraging the bene˜t of wide network of distributors and retailers spread across all the 

districts on a pan India basis. This helps the channel partners to source all type of Furniture requirements of their 

customers in the furniture domain from a single principal. This is in a way win win proposition for the channel 

partners as it provides sustainable growth and pro˜tability and also helps them to build a lifelong customer base 

horizon as the products serve the customer™s needs during each stage of their life cycle. The product portfolio 

which starts from the basic plastic chair/ plastic storage solution/ Dining Tables evolves further into all segments 

like bedroom, dining, living room, essentials and mattresses which are needed at different points during their 

aspirational home building journey. The company has also spread its product portfolio to serve the institutional 

segment especially in segments like of˜ce seating, desking and storage solutions. The product assortment covers 

both the large institutions and small of˜ce/home of˜ce™s needs.
Both the ready furniture and mattress industry have displayed double digit growth and we ˜rmly believe that 
this growth rate would continue at the same levels in the years to come with the per capita income growth and 

lifestyle changes which are rapidly taking place due to the India growth story.
In the moulded business the Company has introduced around 10 new products all of which were well accepted 
in the market. This is one of the main reasons why we could deliver a growth of over 5% in the last ˜nancial 

year in a highly competitive market with around 150 plus regional players. To keep up the momentum, the 

company is planning to further augment the range of differentiated products in the chair and storage segment 

in the ˜nancial year 2019-20 to ˜ll the gaps and bring in product freshness. The distribution base spread across 

every district of our vast country will increase the visibility quotient and this coupled with our ability to manage 

supply chain equation at a lower cost as compared to industry norms would be our ﬁright to winﬂ because of our 

multi segment/ multi locational plants serving as a strong differentiating factor. Our strong supply chain system 

backed by 40 depots will also help our channel partners to reduce their inventory and enhance their return on 

investment apart from having an edge of delivering our products ef˜ciently to even the remotest corner of the 

country. The multi locational production facilities has helped us immensely in enhancing the market penetration 

and improve our ˜ll rate to the general trade, modern trade and E-Commerce portals across the country. Your 

company would be investing in technology to further support the seamless supply chain management expertise 

and would continue to focus on this aspect in the current year.
During the ˜nancial year we have added 18 Franchise showrooms which is in addition to the already existing 44 
Nilkamal home ideas and furniture ideas showrooms. These showrooms would be showcasing all the verticals 

marketed by the company and they would be backed by continuous investment in ATL and BTL activities to 

improve the directional selling drive. This is based on our strong belief that it will augment the strong recall of 

Nilkamal brand in the existing more than 6 Cr. strong household base built over 4 decades. The company plans 

to appoint additional 20 franchisee in targeted centers in the ˜nancial year 2019-20.
In the mattress segment the company has been making a steady growth with a 30% CAGR over the last 3 
years and emerged as national player in all the 3 segments i.e. coir, spring and foam. Your company has put 

up production facilities in all the 4 zone™s of the country. We have introduced quality products in the medium 

and premium segments which has been well accepted by the trade. The Company believe that it would be in a 

position to grow 2-3 times the industry growth rate, the focus being on improving our reach and penetration 

through our 1,000+ distributors spread across the country and developing differentiated products.
We strongly believe that a stable GST regime and strictness in implementation of E-Way bill will reduce the 
proliferation of unorganised players resorting to unethical practices of evasion of taxes and this itself will lead 

to a level playing ˜eld helping the organised sectors to grow their revenues. Being a leader any positive impact 

would result in incremental gains for your Company.
Stability in crude prices and strengthening of our currency would also be aiding factors in the short and medium 
term. However any adverse ˚uctuations or uncertainty in the political environment can be a cause for concern 

as it would impact the growth and margins in the medium term.

Material Handling Business
Financial Year 2018-19 began on strong note of growth in 3 Quarters and then into a slowdown effect resulting 
in overall increase in revenues of 14% for Material Handling business. This business has unique value propositions 

in terms of protecting customer™s products, improve customer™s storage ef˜ciency & increase customer™s labour 

productivity.
Consolidation in B2B businesses after GST implementation combined with high growth of E-commerce has 
resulted in increase in demand for larger warehouses requiring usage of Material Handling products, thereby 

increasing the demand, especially for Pallets backed by industries shift to plastic pallets from conventional 

wooden pallets.
Many new models of crates for reducing reverse logistics costs for customers are being introduced which have a 
very good scope in auto & E-commerce which along with additional capacities being created in south will poise 

well to cater to the growing demand in southern region by being closer to customers.
Sales of our products for waste management & road safety grew by 40% during the year and continue to see 
high potential riding the Government™s initiatives of Swachha Bharat and infrastructure developments.
New product ranges making our offering a complete ﬁOne Stop Solutionﬂ for intralogistics material handling 
with additional capacities in different geographical regions of India and focus on reduction of costs will further 

strengthen our position as market leader in the segment.
Initiative of ﬁ Improve Man Power Productivity ﬁ and ﬁFIT for GROWTHﬂ of automation in manufacturing , 
reorganization of warehouse locations, use of BI tools for truck loading have started showing positive results & 

full bene˜ts of same will be realised in the coming years.
Recent slowdown in automobile & industrial Sectors, rising crude prices due to global politics impacting raw 
material prices and below normal monsoon are challenges to revenue growth & pro˜tability for the coming Year.
All our three ventures Cambro Nilkamal Pvt Ltd, Nilkamal Bito Storage system Pvt ltd and Nilkamal Crates & Bins, 
Ajman continued to have strong growth in ˜nancial year 2018-19.
Our twin pronged approach of appointing strong dealers and an increased ˜eld sales force targeting hotels, 
corporates, industrial canteens, restaurants, caterers and fast food chains coupled with a large increased product 

range contributed to the success of hospitality Joint Venture. With products catering to all price segments 

and strategically placed inventory, servicing all geographic locations promptly, aided the said Joint Venture to 

perform well.
Our racking and shelving Joint Venture has been successful in tapping into ongoing warehousing infrastructure 
developments triggered by the introduction of GST. We expect strong growth as warehousing development in 

India is considered to be in nascent stage and increase demand for warehousing & distribution centers for full ˜ll 

ment by all type of industries, retailers and E-commerce players will continue in foreseeable future.
BubbleGUARD 
today is still a nascent and growing product category. We have achieved sales growth of 210% 
year on year on a small base and are targeting to double the top line during the current ˜nancial year.

There is huge scope of growth as calls for single-use packaging and non-sustainable materials to be discontinued 
grows. We have just introduced Pallet GUARD as a returnable space-saving solution and all our products are 

engineered for reusability and recyclability. This will be the future of packaging which will boost us to continue 

to develop innovative products.
The current market capacity is able to sustain the current demand. We foresee this demand to rise as the material 
gains more acceptance in mainstream applications. Excessive capacity in the market or counterfeit material poses 

a threat to low-value applications for Bubble GUARD however the packaging market in India is very large and 

will remain fragmented across materials.
Volatile plastic raw material pricing continues to be a concern as we see high growth coming from institutional 
packaging which requires 3-6 month price contracts creating uncertainty on margins.
Lifestyle Furniture, Furnishing and Accessories Division:

In its constant endeavor of making lives beautiful, @home now has 19 large format retail stores and 11 shop-in-
shop stores across 21 cities and having retail footprint of more than three lakhs square feet with a robust digital

`
 210.89Cr of revenue against last year 
`
 214.78 Cr. The @home business continued 
to remain pro˜table at corporate level.
The business has demonstrated ˜nancial prudence by fueling expansion using the franchise model and the 
Shop-In-Shop (SIS) concept. Franchise stores in Indore and Rajkot have proven pro˜table for both, @home and 

the franchisee. While franchises in Lucknow and Chennai have been signed, other proposals are also in the 

pipeline. The business looks to add more than 30,000 sq.ft retail space with these approaches without employing 

additional capital.
40
Digital adoption for this category is growing. Online marketplaces have invested huge marketing monies to 
drive interest in this category and @home is looking forward to ride the wave further by growing at more than 

20% in FY 20 as well. Also, a revamp of the website will help driving web visitors to stores thereby creating 

of˚ine walk-ins and higher ticket values.
@home expects the organized furniture and homeware buying share to rise, thereby helping business to grow. 
While it is necessary to watch out for the investment coming in from both online as well as from of˚ine players.

Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements

other comprehensive income), standalone Statement of Changes in Equity and standalone Statement of Cash 

Flows for the year then ended, and notes to the standalone financial statements, including a summary of 

the signi˜cant accounting policies and other explanatory information (herein after referred to as ﬁstandalone 

˜nancial statementsﬂ).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid 
standalone ˜nancial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (ﬁActﬂ) in the manner 

so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in 

India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at 31 March 2019, its pro˜t and other comprehensive income, 

changes in equity and its cash ˚ows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) speci˜ed under section 143(10) of 

the Act. Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the ‚Auditor™s Responsibilities for the Audit 

of the Standalone Financial Statements™ section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance 

with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ﬁICAIﬂ) together with the 

ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone ˜nancial statements under the provisions 

of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have ful˜lled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 

these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suf˜cient and 

appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signi˜cance in our audit 
of the standalone ˜nancial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of 

our audit of the standalone ˜nancial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not 

provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Revenue Recognition

See Note 27 to the Standalone Financial Statements
The key audit matter
How the matter was addressed in our audit
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured net of discounts and sales 

incentives/schemes earned by customers on the 

Company™s sales.

Due to the Company™s presence across different 

marketing regions within the country and the 

competitive business environment, the estimation of 

the various types of discounts and sales incentives/

schemes to be recognised based on sales made during 

the year is material and considered to be judgmental.

Therefore, there is a risk of revenue being misstated as 

a result of erroneous estimations over discounts and 

sales incentives/schemes.

Revenue is recognised when the control of the 

products being sold has transferred to the customer. 

Therefore, there is a risk of revenue being overstated 

on account of variation in the timing of transfer of 

control, due to the pressure management may feel to 

achieve performance targets at the reporting period 

end.
Our audit procedures included:
a.
 
Assessing the 
appropriateness of the revenue 
recognition accounting policies, including 

those relating to discounts and sales incentives/

schemes by comparing with applicable accounting 

standards.
b.
 
Testing the 
design, implementation and operating 
effectiveness of the Company™s general IT controls 

and key IT/manual application controls over the 

Company™s systems which govern recording of 

revenue, creation of new customers, discounts 

and sales incentives/schemes in the general ledger 

accounting system.
c.
 
Performing substantive testing (including year-end 
cut-off testing) by selecting samples of revenue 

transactions recorded during the year (and before 

and after the financial year end), including one 

off sales to customers, by verifying the underlying 

documents, which included sales invoices/contracts 

and shipping documents.
d.
 
We compared the historical discounts and sales 
incentives/schemes to current payment trends. 

We also considered the historical accuracy of the 

Company™s estimates in previous years.
e.
 
Performing substantive testing by checking 
samples of discounts and sales incentives/schemes 

transactions to supporting documentation.
f.
 
We assessed manual journals posted to revenue to 
identify unusual items.
g.
 
Considering the adequacy of the Company™s 
disclosures in respect of revenue.
42
Independent Auditors™ Report
Information other then the ˜nancial statements and Auditors report thereon (ﬁOther Informationﬂ)
The Company™s management and Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other 
information comprises the information included in the Company™s annual report, but does not include the 

˜nancial statements and our auditors™ report thereon.
Our opinion on the standalone ˜nancial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone ˜nancial statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the 

standalone ˜nancial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or other wise appears to be materially 

misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this 

other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Management™s Responsibility for the Standalone Financial 
Statements
The Company™s management and Board of Directors are responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of 

the Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone ˜nancial statements that give a true and fair view 

of the state of affairs, pro˜t and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash ˚ows of the Company 

in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting 

Standards (Ind AS) speci˜ed under section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of 

adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safe guarding of the assets 

of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other ir regularities; selection and application 

of appropriate accounting policies ;making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;and 

design,implementation and maintenance of adequate internal ˜nancial controls that were operating 

effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation 

and presentation of the standalone ˜nancial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from 

material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone ˜nancial statements, management and Board of Directors are responsible for 
assessing the Company™s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 

concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the 

Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Company™s ˜nancial reporting process.

Auditor™s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone ˜nancial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor™s report that includes 

our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted 

in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 

fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 

to in˚uence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone ˜nancial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:


to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence 

that is suf˜cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 

misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 

forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing 

our opinion on whether the company has adequate internal ˜nancial controls with reference to ˜nancial 

statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
and related disclosures made by management.

on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that 

may cast signi˜cant doubt on the Company™s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a 

material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor™s report to the related disclosures 

in the standalone ˜nancial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our 

conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor™s report. However, future 

events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.


the disclosures, and whether the standalone ˜nancial statements represent the underlying transactions and 

events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 

timing of the audit and signi˜cant audit ˜ndings, including any signi˜cant de˜ciencies in internal control that 

we identify during our audit.
43
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that 

may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of 
most signi˜cance in the audit of the standalone ˜nancial statements of the current period and are therefore the 

key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors™ report unless law or regulation precludes public 

disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not 

be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to 

outweigh the public interest bene˜ts of such communication.

the Company has physically veri˜ed certain ˜xed assets during the year and we are informed that no 

material discrepancies were noticed on such veri˜cation.

Report on the internal ˜nancial controls with reference to the aforesaid standalone ˜nancial 

statements under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013
(Referred to in paragraph (1(A)(f)) under ‚Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements™ 
section of our report of even date)
Opinion

We have audited the internal ˜nancial controls with reference to ˜nancial statements of Nilkamal Limited(ﬁthe 
Companyﬂ) as of 31 March 2019 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone ˜nancial statements of the 

Company for the year ended on that date.
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, adequate internal ˜nancial controls with reference 
to ˜nancial statements and such internal ˜nancial controls were operating effectively as at 31
st
 March 2019, 
based on the internal ˜nancial controls with reference to ˜nancial statements criteria established by the 

Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of 

Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India 

(the ﬁGuidance Noteﬂ)
Management™s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls

The Company™s management and the Board of Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining 
internal ˜nancial controls based on the internal ˜nancial controls with reference to ˜nancial statements criteria 

established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance 

Note. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal ˜nancial 

controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and ef˜cient conduct of its business, including 

adherence to company™s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and 

errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable ˜nancial 

information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as ﬁthe Actﬂ).
47
Annexure to Auditors™ Report
Auditors™ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company™s internal ˜nancial controls with reference to ˜nancial 
statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards 

on Auditing, prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal ˜nancial 

controls with reference to ˜nancial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply 

with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 

adequate internal ˜nancial controls with reference to ˜nancial statements were established and maintained 

and whether such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal ˜nancial 
controls with reference to ˜nancial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal ˜nancial 

controls with reference to ˜nancial statements included obtaining an understanding of such internal ˜nancial 

controls, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating 

effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor™s 

judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone ˜nancial statements, 

whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suf˜cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinion on the Company™s internal ˜nancial controls with reference to ˜nancial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial controls with Reference to Financial Statements

A company™s internal ˜nancial controls with reference to ˜nancial statements is a process designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of ˜nancial reporting and the preparation of ˜nancial statements 

for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company™s internal ˜nancial 

controls with reference to ˜nancial statements include those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 

maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly re˚ect the transactions and dispositions 

of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to 

permit preparation of ˜nancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and 

that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of 

management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely 

detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company™s assets that could have a material 

effect on the ˜nancial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial controls with Reference to Financial Statements

Because of the inherent limitations of internal ˜nancial controls with reference to ˜nancial statements, including 
the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or 

fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal ˜nancial controls with 

reference to ˜nancial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal ˜nancial controls with 

reference to ˜nancial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree 

of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The  Company offsets tax assets and liabilities if and only if it has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and current tax liabilities and the 
deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority.

Signi˜cant management judgment is required in determining provision for income tax, deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
and recoverability of 

deferred income tax assets. The recoverability of deferred income tax assets is based on estimates of taxable income  in which 
the relevant entity operates 

and the period over which deferred income tax assets will be recovered.

Signi˜cant accounting policies
 
a)
 
Basis of preparation of Financial Statements:
 
  
The Financial Statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting 
Standards (Ind AS) to comply with the section 133 of the Companies Act 2013(ﬁthe 2013 Actﬂ), read with 
Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, and Companies (Indian Accounting 

Standards ) Rules, 2016. The ˜nancial statements were authorised for issue by the Company™s Board of 

Directors on 11
th
 May 2019.
   
All the assets and liabilities have been classi˜ed as current or non current as per the Company™s normal 
operating cycle and other criteria set out in Schedule III to the Act. Based on the nature of products 

and the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realization in cash and cash 

equivalent, the Company has ascertained the operating cycle to be 12 months.
  
Functional and presentation curr
ency:
   
These standalone ˜nancial statements are presented in Indian rupees, which is the Company™s functional 
currency.  All amounts have been rounded off to two decimal places to the nearest lakh, unless otherwise 

indicated.
  
Historical cost convention:
   
The standalone ˜nancial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the 

following:

value;

 
b)
 
Use of Estimates and Judgements:
   
The preparation of ˜nancial statements in accordance with Ind AS requires use of estimates and 
assumptions for some items, which might have an effect on their recognition and measurement in the 

balance sheet and statement of pro˜t and loss. The actual amounts realised may differ from these 

estimates.
  
Estimates and assumptions are required in particular for:


    
Useful lives of property plant and equipment are based on the life prescribed in Schedule II of the 
Companies Act, 2013. In cases, where the useful lives are different from that prescribed in Schedule 

II for plant and machinery and dies and moulds, they are based on technical advice, taking into 

account the nature of the asset, the estimated usage of the asset, the operating conditions of the 

asset, past history of replacement, anticipated technological changes, manufacturers™ warranties 

and maintenance support. 


    
The obligation arising from de˜ned bene˜t plan is determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions. 
Key actuarial assumptions include discount rate, trends in salary escalation, actuarial rates and life 

expectancy. The discount rate is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting 

period on government bonds. The period to maturity of the underlying bonds correspond to the 

probable maturity of the post-employment bene˜t obligations.


    
Deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary 
differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and 

unutilized business loss and depreciation carry-forwards and tax credits. Deferred tax assets are 

recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against 

which the deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses, depreciation carry-forwards and 

unused tax credits could be utilized.



    
The recognition and measurement of other provisions are based on the assessment of the probability 
of an out˚ow of resources, and on past experience and circumstances known at the balance sheet 

date. The actual out˚ow of resources at a future date may therefore vary from the amount included 

in other provisions. 

    
All ˜nancial assets / liabilities are required to be measured at fair value on initial recognition. In case 
of ˜nancial liabilities / assets which are required to subsequently be measured at amortised cost, 

interest is accrued using the effective interest method.
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements
 

    
At inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether the arrangement is or contains 
a lease.
    
At inception or on reassessment of an arrangement that contains a lease, the Company separates 
payments and other consideration required by the arrangement into those for the lease and those 

for other elements on the basis of their relative fair values. If the Company concludes for a ˜nance 

lease that it is impracticable to separate the payments reliably, then an asset and a liability are 

recognised at an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying asset; subsequently, the liability is 

reduced as payments are made and an imputed ˜nance cost on the liability is recognised using the 

Company™s incremental borrowing rate. And in case of operating lease, treat all payments under the 

arrangement as lease payments.


    
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to 
the chief operating Decision Maker. The Company prepares its segment information in conformity 

with the accounting policies adopted for preparing and presenting the ˜nancial statements of the 

Company as a whole.

    
Derivatives are carried at fair value. Derivatives includes foreign currency forward contracts and 
interest rate swaps. Fair value of foreign currency forward contracts are determined using the 

fair value reports provided by respective merchant bankers. Fair value of interest rate swaps are 

determined with respect to current market rate of interest.

  
  
The Company™s accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values for 
˜nancial instruments. 
    
The Company has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. 
The management regularly reviews signi˜cant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If 

third party information, such as broker quotes or pricing services, is used to measure fair values, then 

the management assesses the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion 

that such valuations meet the requirements of Ind AS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy 

in which such valuations should be classi˜ed.
    
When measuring the fair value of a ˜nancial asset or a ˜nancial liability, the Company uses 
observable market data as far as possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair 
value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows.
 

Level 1
: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

inputs).
    
If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the 
fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level 

of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is signi˜cant to the entire measurement.
 
c)
 
Standards issued but not yet ef
fective
   
On March 30, 2019, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) noti˜ed Ind AS 116, ‚Leases™ as part of the 

Companies (Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS)) Amendment Rules, 2019. Ind AS 116 - Leases replaces 

existing standard on leases i.e. Ind AS 17, Leases with effect from accounting periods beginning on or 

after 1st April 2019. 
   
It eliminates the classi˜cation of leases as either ˜nance leases or operating leases for a lessee as required 
by Ind AS 17. Ind AS 116 introduces a single lessee accounting model and requires a lessee to recognise 

assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of 

low value. 
   
A lessee is required to recognise a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying leased 
asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. Requirements with 

regard to lessor accounting are substantially similar to accounting requirements contained in Ind AS 

17. Accordingly, a lessor will continue to classify its leases as operating leases or ˜nance leases, and to 
account for those two types of leases differently.
67
   
The Company™s operating leases primarily relate to premises, vehicles , IT equipment because all these 
assets satisfy the principle of identi˜cation and ˜xed minimum lease payments.
   
The Company proposes to adopt the above standard using modi˜ed retrospective approach, recognising 
the lease liability as the present value of the remaining lease  payments, discounted at the incremental 
borrowing rate and equivalent amount of right to use.
   
Based on the information currently available, the Company estimates that it will recognise a right to use 
asset of approximately
 
 
`
 13,422.42 Lakhs and a corresponding lease liability of approx. 
`
 13,422.42 lakhs. 
There will be consequent reclassi˜cation in the cash ˚ow categories in the statement of cash ˚ows.
 
d)
 
Property, plant and equipment:


    
Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any 

accumulated impairment losses.
    
The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises:
    
Its purchase 
price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade 
discounts and rebates.
    
Any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to 
be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
    
The initial estimate of the costs of dismantling 
and removing the item and restoring the site on 
which it is located, the obligation for which an entity incurs either when the item is acquired or as a 

consequence of having used the item during a particular period for purposes other than to produce 

inventories during that period.
    
Income and expenses related to the incidental operations, not necessary to bring the item to the 
location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by 

management, are recognised in pro˜t or loss.
    
Items such as spare parts, stand-by equipments and servicing that meets the de˜nition of property, 
plant and equipment are capitalised at cost and depreciated over the useful life.
    
If signi˜cant parts 
of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, then they 
are accounted and depreciated for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and 

equipment.
    
Any gain 
or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in pro˜t or 
loss.


  
  
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that the future economic bene˜ts 
associated with the expenditure will ˚ow to the Company.
 
e)
 
Depr
eciation: 
 

as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 except for plant and machinery 

and Dies and moulds which is based on technical  evaluation.  Management believes that these 

useful lives best represent the period over which management expects to use these assets. Hence 

the useful life for plant and machinery of 10 years and for Dies and Moulds of 6 years for continuous 

running is different from the useful life as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II of the Companies 

Act 2013;
    
Useful life 
of property plant and equipment are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted 
prospectively, if appropriate.

Intangible assets, which are acquired by the Company and have ˜nite useful lives are measured at cost 
less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
   
All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognised 
in pro˜t or loss as incurred. 
 
g)
 
Amortisation:
   
Software (Intangible assets) are amortised over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis but 

not exceeding the period of 36 months.
   
Useful life of Intangible 
assets are  reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted prospectively, if 
appropriate.
 
h)
 
Financial Instruments:
 
  
A ˜nancial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a ˜nancial asset of one entity and a ˜nancial 
liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial instruments also include derivative contracts 

such as foreign currency foreign exchange forward contracts and, interest rate swaps and currency 

options; and embedded derivatives in the host contract.
   
Financial instruments also covers contracts to buy or sell a non-˜nancial item that can be settled net in 
cash or another ˜nancial instrument, or by exchanging ˜nancial instruments, as if the contracts were 

˜nancial instruments, with the exception of contracts that were entered into and continue to be held 

for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of a non-˜nancial item in accordance with the entity™s expected 

purchase, sale or usage requirements.
   
Derivatives are currently recognized at fair value on the date on which the derivative contract is entered 
into and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period.
  
Cash Flow Hedges
 
  
The Company uses derivative ˜nancial instrument such as forward contracts and cross currency interest 
rate swaps to hedge its foreign currency risks and interest rate risks. Derivative ˜nancial instruments 

are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are 

subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as ˜nancial assets when the fair value is 

positive and as ˜nancial liabilities when the fair value is negative. 
   
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to the 
Statement of Pro˜t and Loss, except for the effective portion of cash ˚ow hedge, which is recognised in 

Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated in Cash Flow Hedge Reserve included in the Reserves and 

Surplus while any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Statement of Pro˜t and Loss.
  
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classi˜ed as: 
   
Fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or 
liability.
   
Cash ˚ow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash ˚ows that is either attributable to 
particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability.
   
At the inception 
of a hedge relationship, the Company formally designates and documents the hedge 
relationship to which the Company wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective 

and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identi˜cation of the hedging 

instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity 

will assess the effectiveness of changes in the hedging instrument™s fair value in offsetting the exposure 

to changes in the hedged item™s fair value or cash ˚ows attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges 

are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash ˚ows and are 

assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the 

˜nancial reporting periods for which they were designated.
   
Hedge accounting is discontinued from the last testing date when the hedging instrument expires or is 
sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer quali˜es for hedge accounting. Cumulative gain or loss on 

such hedging instrument recognised in Cash Flow Hedge Reserve is retained there until the forecasted 

transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss 

recognised in Cash Flow Hedge Reserve is transferred to Statement of Pro˜t and Loss for the year.

Financial Assets
  
Classi˜cation
 
  
The Company shall classify ˜nancial assets as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through 
other comprehensive income or fair value through pro˜t or loss on the basis of its business model for 
managing the ˜nancial assets and the contractual cash ˚ow characteristics of the ˜nancial asset.
  
Initial recognition and measur
ement
   
All ˜nancial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of ˜nancial assets not recorded at 

fair value through pro˜t or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the ˜nancial 

asset. Purchases or sales of ˜nancial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established 

by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, 

i.e., the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.
  
Debt instruments at amortised cost 
  
A ‚debt instrument™ is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met: 
  
a)
 
 
The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual 
cash ˚ows, and 
  
b)
 
 
Contractual terms 
of the asset give rise on speci˜ed dates to cash ˚ows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. 
    
After initial measurement, such ˜nancial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any 

discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR 

amortisation is included in ˜nance income in the pro˜t or loss. The losses arising from impairment 

are recognised in the pro˜t or loss.  This category generally applies to trade and other receivables.  

For more information on receivables, refer to Note 48.
  
Equity investments 
 
  
All equity investments in scope of Ind-AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are 
held for trading are classi˜ed as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Company decides to 

classify the same either as at FVOCI or FVTPL. The Company makes such election on an instrument-by-

instrument basis. The classi˜cation is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable. 
   
If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as FVOCI, then all fair value changes on the 
instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from 

OCI to pro˜t and loss, even on sale of investment. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative 

gain or loss within equity. 
   
Equity instruments 
included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes 
recognized in the pro˜t and loss.
  
Derecognition 
  
 
A ˜nancial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a ˜nancial asset or part of a Company of similar ˜nancial 
assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from the Company™s balance sheet) when:


obligation to pay the received cash ˚ows in full without material delay to a third party under a 

‚pass-through™ arrangement; and either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks 

and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all 

the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
    
When the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash ˚ows from an asset or has entered 
into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and 

rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and 

rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Company continues to recognise the 

transferred asset to the extent of the Company™s continuing involvement. In that case, the Company 

also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured 

on a basis that re˚ects the rights and obligations that the Company has retained. 
    
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured 
at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration 

that the Company could be required to repay.

Impairment of ˜nancial assets
    
In accordance with Ind-AS 109, the Company applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement 
and recognition of impairment loss on the following ˜nancial assets and credit risk exposure: 
   
a)
 
 
Financial assets 
that are debt instruments, and are measured at amortised cost e.g., loans, debt 
securities, deposits, and bank balance.
   
b)
 
 
Trade receivables - The application of simpli˜ed approach does not require the Company to 
track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime 
ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition. Trade receivables are tested for 

impairment on a speci˜c basis after considering the sanctioned credit limits, security like letters 

of credit, security deposit collected etc. and expectations about future cash ˚ows.
   
Financial liabilities 
   
Classi˜cation
    
The Company classi˜es all ˜nancial liabilities as subsequently measured at amortised cost, except for 

˜nancial liabilities at fair value through pro˜t or loss. Such liabilities, including derivatives that are 

liabilities, shall be subsequently measured at fair value.
   
Initial recognition and measur
ement 
    
Financial liabilities are classi˜ed, at initial recognition, as ˜nancial liabilities at fair value through 
pro˜t or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments 

in an effective hedge, as appropriate. 
    
All ˜nancial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings 
and payables, net of directly attributable and incremental transaction cost.
    
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees 
or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as ˜nance costs in the 

statement of pro˜t and loss.
    
The Company™s ˜nancial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including 
bank overdrafts and derivative ˜nancial instruments.
   
Derecognition 
    
A ˜nancial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled 
or expires. When an existing ˜nancial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on 

substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modi˜ed, such an 

exchange or modi˜cation is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition 

of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement 

of pro˜t or loss. 
   
Offsetting of ˜nancial instruments
    
Financial assets and ˜nancial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance 
sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an 

intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
 
i)
 
Valuation of Inventories:
   
Inventories of Raw Materials, Packing Materials, Stores and Spares, Work-in Progress, T
raded goods and 
Finished goods are valued ‚at cost and net realisable value™ whichever is lower. Cost comprises all cost of 

purchase, appropriate direct production overheads and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories 

to their present location and condition. Cost formulae used is ‚Weighted Average Cost™. Due allowance is 

estimated and made for defective and obsolete items, wherever necessary, based on the past experience 

of the Company. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less 

the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Raw materials 

and other supplies held for use in the production of inventories are not written down below cost except 

in  case where material prices have declined and it is estimated that the cost of the ˜nished product will 

exceed its net realisable value.

j)
 
Employee Bene˜ts:
  
Short Term Employee Bene˜ts
    
All employee bene˜ts payable within twelve months of rendering the service are recognised in the 
period in which the employee renders the related service.
  
Post Employment / Retirement Bene˜ts
   
Contribution to De˜ned Contribution Plans such as Provident Fund, Employees™ State Insurance 
Corporation, etc., are charged to the Statement of Pro˜t and Loss as incurred. 
   
De˜ned Bene˜t Plans Œ The present value of the obligation under such plans, is determined based on an 
actuarial valuation by an independent actuary at the end of each year, using the Projected Unit Credit 

Method. In the case of gratuity, which is funded, the fair value of the plan assets is reduced from the 

gross obligation under the de˜ned bene˜t plans, to recognise the obligation on net basis. 
   
Remeasurement of net de˜ned bene˜t liability, which comprises actuarial gains and losses and the 
return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any excluding interest), 

are recognized immediately in other comprehensive income.
  
Other Long Term Employee Bene˜ts
  
Compensated Absences
   
Accumulated compensated absences, which are expected to be availed or encashed within 12 months 
from the end of the year end are treated as short term employee bene˜ts. The obligation towards the 

same is measured at the expected cost of accumulating compensated absences as the additional amount 

expected to be paid as a result of the unused entitlement as at the year end. Accumulated compensated 

absences, which are expected to be availed or encashed beyond 12 months from the end of the year 

end are treated as other long term employee bene˜ts. The Company™s liability is actuarially determined 

(using the Projected Unit Credit method) at the end of each year. Actuarial losses/ gains are recognised 

in the Statement of Pro˜t and Loss in the year in which they arise.
 
k)
 
Foreign Exchange Transactions:
   
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies of the Company 
at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.
   
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional 
currency at the exchange rate at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured 

at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate when 

the fair value was determined. Foreign currency differences are generally recognised in pro˜t or loss. 

Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using 

the exchange rate as at the date of the transaction.
 
l)
 
Borrowing Costs:
   
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of an asset that necessarily 
takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use are capitalised as part of the cost of 

that asset till the date it is ready for its intended use or sale. Other borrowing costs are recognised as an 

expense in the period in which they are incurred.
 
m)
 
Revenue Recognition:
   
The Company derives revenues primarily from sale of manufactured goods, traded goods and related 
services. 
   
Effective April 1, 2018, the Company has applied Ind AS 115: Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
which establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue 

is to be recognised. Ind AS 115 replaces Ind AS 18 Revenue. The impact of the adoption of the standard 

on the ˜nancial statements of the Company is insigni˜cant.
   
Revenue is recognised on satisfaction of performance obligation upon transfer of control of promised 
products or services to customers in an amount that re˚ects the consideration the Company expects to 

receive in exchange for those products or services. The performance obligations in our contracts are 

ful˜lled at the time of dispatch, delivery or upon formal customer acceptance depending on customer 
terms.
 
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements
72
   
Revenue is measured based on transaction price which is fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable, after deduction of any discounts,  sales incentives / schemes and any taxes or duties collected 
on behalf of the government such as goods and services tax, etc. Accumulated experience is used to 

estimate the provision for such discounts and  sales incentives / schemes. Revenue is only recognised to 

the extent that it is highly probable a signi˜cant reversal will not occur.
   
The Company recognises provision for sales return, based on the historical results, measured on net basis 
of the margin of the sale. An estimate is made of goods that will be returned and a liability is recognised 

for this amount using a best estimate based on accumulated experience. 
   
Dividend income is recognized in statement of pro˜t and loss only when the right to receive payment is 
established.
   
Export incentives receivable under various schemes 
 
are accounted on accrual basis.
  
Interest income is recognized using the effective interest rate 
 
method.
 
n)
 
Leases:

    
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in pro˜t or loss on a straight line basis over 
the term of the lease unless such payments are structured to increase in line with expected general 

in˚ation to compensate for the lessor™s expected in˚ationary cost increase. Lease incentives received 

are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense, over the term of the lease.
    
Minimum lease payments made under ˜nance leases are apportioned between the ˜nance expense 
and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The ˜nance expense is allocated to each period during 

the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the 

liability.

    
Assets held by the Company under leases that transfer to the Company substantially all of the risks 
and rewards of ownership are classi˜ed as ˜nance leases. The leased assets are measured initially 

at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease 

payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the assets are accounted for in accordance with the 

accounting policy applicable to that asset.
    
Assets held under other leases are classi˜ed as operating leases and are not recognised in the 
Company™s statement of ˜nancial position.
 
o)
 
Impairment of non-˜nancial assets
   
The carrying values of assets/cash generating units at each balance sheet date are reviewed for 
impairment if any indication of impairment exists. If the carrying amount of the assets exceed the 

estimated recoverable amount, an impairment is recognised for such excess amount.
   
The recoverable amount is the greater of the net selling price and their value in use. Value in use is 
arrived at by discounting the future cash ˚ows to their present value based on an appropriate discount 

factor. 
   
When there is indication that an impairment loss recognised for an asset (other than a revalued asset) 
in earlier accounting periods which no longer exists or may have decreased, such reversal of impairment 

loss is recognised in the Statement of Pro˜t and Loss, to the extent the amount was previously charged 

to the Statement of Pro˜t and Loss. In case of revalued assets, such reversal is not recognised.
 
p)
 
Cash and cash equivalents
   
Cash and cash equivalent 
in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term 
deposits with remaining maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insigni˜cant risk of 

changes in value.
   
For the purpose of the statement of cash ˚ows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term 
deposits, as de˜ned above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they are considered an integral part 

of the Company™s cash management.

q)
 
T
axation:
   
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. It is recognised in pro˜t or loss except to the 
extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in OCI.
  
i)
 
Current tax
    
Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the 
year and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. It is measured 

using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Current tax also includes any 

tax arising from dividends.
    
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if, the Company:
   
a)
 
 
has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts; and 
   
b)
 
intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
  
ii)
 
Deferred tax
    
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of 

assets and liabilities for ˜nancial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. 

Deferred tax is not recognised for:


a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable pro˜t or loss;


the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is 

probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and


     
Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible 
temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable pro˜ts will be available 

against which they can be used. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are 

reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax bene˜t will be realised; 

such reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable pro˜ts improves.
     
Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognised to the 
extent that it has become probable that future taxable pro˜ts will be available against which 

they can be used.
     
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences 
when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
     
The measurement of deferred tax re˚ects the tax consequences that would follow from the 
manner in which the Company expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying 

amount of its assets and liabilities.
    
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if:
    
a)
 
 
The entity has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities; and
    
b)
 
 
The deferred tax assets and the deferred 
tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the 
same taxation authority on the same taxable entity.
     
Deferred tax asset / liabilities in respect of on temporary differences which originate and reverse 
during the tax holiday period are not recognised. Deferred tax assets / liabilities in respect of 

temporary differences that originate during the tax holiday period but reverse after the tax 

holiday period are recognised.
 
r)
 
Government Grants:
 
  
Grants received from the government are recognized at their fair value where there is reasonable 
assurance that the grant will be received and the Company will comply with the conditions.
   
Government grants related to income are deferred and recognized in the pro˜t or loss over the period 
necessary to match them with the costs that they are intended to compensate and netted off with the 

expense in the statement of pro˜t and loss.
   
Government grants related to purchase of property plant and equipment are recognised as deferred 
income and are credited to pro˜t or loss on a straight line basis over expected life of the related asset 

and presented within other income.

s)
 
Provisions, Contingent Assets and Contingent Liabilities:
  
 
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash ˚ows speci˜c to the liability. The 
unwinding of the discount is recognised as ˜nance cost. A provision for onerous contracts is measured 
at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected 

net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Company recognises any 

impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.
   
A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation 
that may, but will probably not, require an out˚ow of resources. When there is a possible obligation or 

a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of out˚ow of resources is remote, no provision or 

disclosure is made.
   
A contingent asset is not recognised but disclosed in the ˜nancial statements where an in˚ow of 
economic bene˜t is probable.

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements
ii. Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of ˜nancial loss to the Company if a customer or counter party to a ˜nancial 
instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company™s receivables 

from customers and loans and advances.
The carrying amount of following ˜nancial assets represents the maximum credit exposure:
Trade receivables and loans and advances.

The Company™s exposure to credit risk is in˚uenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each 
customer in which it operates. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits 

and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms 

in the normal course of business.
The Risk Management Committee has established a credit policy under which each new customer is 
analysed individually for creditworthiness before the Company™s standard payment and delivery terms and 

conditions are offered. Further for domestic sales, the company segments the customers into Distributors 

and Others for credit monitoring.
The Company maintains security deposits for sales made to its distributors. For other trade receivables, 
the company individually monitors the sanctioned credit limits as against the outstanding balances. 

Accordingly, the Company makes speci˜c provisions against such trade receivables wherever required and 

monitors the same at periodic intervals.

The Company monitors each loans and advances given and makes any speci˜c provision wherever required.
The Company establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in 
respect of trade receivables and loans and advances.

iv. Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices Œ such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and 
equity prices Œ will affect the Company™s income or the value of its holdings of ˜nancial instruments. 

Market risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive ˜nancial instruments including foreign currency 

receivables and payables and long term debt. We are exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign 

exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and the market value of our investments. Thus, our exposure to 

market risk is a function of investing and borrowing activities and revenue generating and operating 

activities in foreign currency. The objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure in 

our foreign currency revenues and costs.
Currency risk
The Company is exposed to currency risk on account of its borrowings and other payables in foreign 
currency. The functional currency of the Company is Indian Rupee. The Company uses forward exchange 

contracts to hedge its currency risk, most with a maturity of less than one year from the reporting date.
Exposure to currency risk (Exposure in different currencies converted to functional currency 
 
i.e. INR)

Sensitivity analysis
A reasonably possible strengthening (weakening) of the foreign Currency  against the Indian Rupee 
at 31
st
 March would have affected the measurement of ˜nancial instruments denominated in foreign 
currencies and affected equity and pro˜t or loss by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that 

all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant and ignores any impact of forecast sales 

and purchases..

Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk can be either fair value interest rate risk or cash flow interest rate risk. Fair value interest 
rate risk is the risk of changes in fair values of fixed interest bearing investments because of fluctuations 

in the interest rates. Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of floating interest 

bearing investments will fluctuate because of fluctuations in the interest rates.
Exposure to interest rate risk
Company™s interest rate risk arises from borrowings. The interest rate profile of the Company™s interest-
bearing financial instruments as reported to the management of the Company is as follows.

Hedge accounting
The Company™s risk management policy is to hedge  its estimated foreign currency exposure in respect 
of highly probable forecast purchases and foreign currency borrowings. The Company uses forward 

exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk and cross currency interest rate swap to hedge its interest 

rate and currency risk related to foreign currency borrowings. Such contracts are generally designated as 

cash ˚ow hedges.
The Company determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument 
and hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash ˚ows. The Company 

assesses whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be and has been 

effective in offsetting changes in the cash ˚ows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative 

method.

Nilkamal Limited
Consolidated Auditor™s Report
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS™ REPORT
To the Members of Nilkamal Limited
Report on the Audit of Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements
Opinion

We have audited the consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial statements of Nilkamal Limited (hereinafter referred to 
as the ‚Holding Companyﬂ) and its subsidiaries (Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to 

as ﬁthe Groupﬂ), and its joint ventures, which comprise the consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31 March 2019, 

and the consolidated Statement of Pro˜t and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income) ,
 
consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity and consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended, and notes 

to the consolidated ˜nancial statements, including a summary of signi˜cant accounting policies and other 

explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as ﬁthe consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial statementsﬂ).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, and based on 
the consideration of reports of other auditors on separate ˜nancial statements of such subsidiaries and joint 

ventures as were audited by the other auditors, the aforesaid consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial statements give the 

information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (ﬁActﬂ) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view 

in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of 

the Group and its joint ventures as at 31 March 2019, of its consolidated pro˜t and other comprehensive income, 

consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash ˚ows for the year then ended.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) speci˜ed under section 143(10) of 

the Act. Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the ‚Auditor™s Responsibilities for the Audit 

of the Consolidated Financial Statements™ section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance 

with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, and we have ful˜lled our other 

ethical responsibilities in accordance with the provisions of the Act. 
Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signi˜cance in our audit of 
the consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context 

of our audit of the consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and 

we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matter described below to the 

key audit matter to be communicated in our report.
Description of Key Audit Matter

Revenue Recognition

See Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
The key audit matter
How the matter was addressed in our audit
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured net of discounts and sales 

incentives/schemes earned by customers on the 

Company™s sales.

Due to the Company™s presence across different 

marketing regions within the country and 

the competitive business environment, the 

estimation of the various types of discounts and 

sales incentives/schemes to be recognised based 

on sales made during the year is material and 

considered to be judgmental
. 
Therefore, there 
is a risk of revenue being misstated as a result of 

erroneous estimations over discounts and sales 

incentives/schemes.

Revenue is recognised when the control of 

the products being sold has transferred to the 

customer. Therefore, there is a risk of revenue 

being overstated on account of variation in the 

timing of transfer of control due to the pressure 

management may feel to achieve performance 

targets at the reporting period end.
Our audit procedures included:
a.
 
Assessing the appropriateness of the revenue 
recognition accounting policies, including those relating 

to discounts and sales incentives/schemes by comparing 

with applicable accounting standards.
b.
 
Testing the design, implementation and operating 

effectiveness of the Company™s general IT controls and 

key IT/manual application controls over the Company™s 

systems which govern recording of revenue, creation of 

new customers, discounts and sales incentives/schemes 

in the general ledger accounting system.
c.
 
Performing substantive testing (including year-end cut-

off testing) by selecting samples of revenue transactions 

recorded during the year (and before and after the 

˜nancial year end), including one off sales to customers, 

by verifying the underlying documents, which included 

sales invoices/contracts and shipping documents.
d.
 
We compared the historical discounts and sales 

incentives/schemes to current payment trends. We also 

considered the historical accuracy of the Company™s 

estimates in previous years.
e.
 
Performing substantive testing by checking samples of 

discounts and sales incentives/schemes transactions to 

supporting documentation.
f.
 
We assessed manual journals posted to revenue to 

identify unusual items.
g.
 
Considering the adequacy of the Company™s disclosures 
in respect of revenue.
93

92
Information other than the ˜nancial statements and Auditors™ report thereon (ﬁOther Informationﬂ)
The Holding Company™s management and Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The 
other information comprises the information included in the holding Company™s annual report, but does not 

include the ˜nancial statements and our auditors™ report thereon.
Our opinion on the consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial statements does not cover the other information and we do 
not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial statements, our responsibility is to read the 
other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the 

consolidated ˜nancial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially 

misstated. If, based on the work we have performed and based on the work done/ audit report of other auditors, 

we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. 

We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated 

Ind AS Financial Statements
The Holding Company™s management and Board of Directors are responsible for the preparation and presentation 

of these consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial statements in term of the requirements of the Act that give a true and 

fair view of the consolidated state of affairs, consolidated pro˜t and other comprehensive income, consolidated 

statement of changes in equity and consolidated cash ˚ows of the Group including its joint ventures in accordance 

with the 
accounting principles generally accepted in India, 
including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind 
AS) speci˜ed under section 133 of the Act. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the 

Group and joint ventures are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with 

the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of each company. and for preventing and detecting frauds 

and other irregularities; the selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments 

and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate 

internal ˜nancial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring accuracy and completeness of the 

accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial statements 

that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have 

been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial statements by the Directors of the 

Holding Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial statements, the respective management and Board of Directors 
of the companies included in the Group and its joint ventures are responsible for assessing the ability of each 

company to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using 

the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease 

operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and its joint ventures is responsible for 
overseeing the ˜nancial reporting process of each company.
Auditor™s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial statements 
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor™s report 

that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 

conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can 

arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably 

be expected to in˚uence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial 

statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain 

audit evidence that is suf˜cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting 

a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 

collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 

are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing 

our opinion on whether the company has adequate internal ˜nancial controls with reference to ˜nancial 

statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 

related disclosures made by management.
Conclude on the appropriateness of management™s use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation 

of consolidated ˜nancial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
Nilkamal Limited
Consolidated Auditor™s Report
94
95
94
Nilkamal Limited
Consolidated Auditor™s Report
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signi˜cant doubt on the appropriateness of 
this assumption. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our 

auditor™s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated ˜nancial statements or, if such disclosures are 

inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date 

of our auditor™s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group (company and subsidiaries) 

as well as 
joint ventures 
to cease to continue as a going concern.
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial statements, 

including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial statements represent the underlying 

transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
Obtain suf˜cient appropriate audit evidence regarding the ˜nancial information of such entities or business 

activities within the Group and 
joint ventures 
to express an opinion on the consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial 
statements, of which we are the independent auditors. We are responsible for the direction, supervision 

and performance of the audit of ˜nancial information of such entities. For the other entities included in the 

consolidated ˜nancial statements, which have been audited by other auditors, such other auditors remain 

responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain 

solely responsible for our audit opinion. Our responsibilities in this regard are further described in para (a) of 

the section titled ‚Other Matters™ in this audit report.
We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us along with the consideration of audit reports of the other 
auditors referred to in sub-paragraph (a) of the Other Matters paragraph below, is suf˜cient and appropriate 

to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company and such other entities included 

in the consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among 

other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and signi˜cant audit ˜ndings, including any signi˜cant 

de˜ciencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that 

may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were 
of most signi˜cance in the audit of the consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial statements of the current period and are 

therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors™ report unless law or regulation 

precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a 

matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would 

reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest bene˜ts of such communication.
Other Matters

(a) We did not audit the ˜nancial statements of four subsidiaries whose ˜nancial statements re˚ect total assets 
of Rs. 5,264.19 lakhs as at 31 March 2019, total revenues of Rs. 7,278.60 lakhs and net cash in˚ows amounting 
to Rs. 428.73 lakhs for the year ended on that date, as considered in the consolidated
 
˜nancial statements. 
The consolidated ˜nancial statements also include the Group™s share of net pro˜t (and other comprehensive 

income) of Rs. 418.99 lakhs for the year ended 31 March 2019 as considered in the Consolidated Financial 

Statements, in respect of one joint venture, whose ˜nancial statements/˜nancial information have not been 

audited by us. These ˜nancial statements/˜nancial information have been audited by other auditors whose 

reports have been furnished to us by the Management and our opinion on the consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial 

statements, in so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in respect of these subsidiaries and 

its 
joint venture
, and our report in terms of sub-section (3)
 
of Section 143 of the Act, in so far as it relates to 
the aforesaid subsidiaries and its joint ventures is based solely on the audit reports of the other auditors.
Certain of these subsidiaries
 
are located outside India whose ˜nancial statements and other ˜nancial 
information have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in their 
respective countries and which have been audited by other auditors under generally accepted auditing 

standards applicable in their respective countries. The Company™s management has converted the ˜nancial 

statements of such subsidiaries located outside India from accounting principles generally accepted in their 

respective countries to accounting principles generally accepted in India. We have audited these conversion 

adjustments made by the Company™s management. Our opinion in so far as it relates to the balances and 

affairs of such subsidiaries located outside India is based on the report of other auditors and the conversion 

adjustments prepared by the management of the Company and audited by us.
Our opinion on the consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial statements, and our report on Other Legal and Regulatory 

Requirements below, is not modi˜ed in respect of the above matters with respect to our reliance on the work 

done and the reports of the other auditors.

In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated ˜nancial statements of the Company as of and for the year 
ended 31 March 2019, we have audited the internal ˜nancial controls with reference to consolidated ˜nancial 

statements of Nilkamal Limited (hereinafter referred to as ﬁthe Holding Companyﬂ) and such companies 

incorporated in India under the Companies Act, 2013 (‚the Actﬂ) which are its subsidiary companies and its joint 

venture companies, as of that date.
In our opinion, the Holding Company and such companies incorporated in India which are its subsidiary companies 
and joint venture companies (jointly controlled companies), have, in all material respects, adequate internal 

˜nancial controls with reference to consolidated ˜nancial statements and such internal ˜nancial controls were 

operating effectively as at 31 March 2019, based on the internal ˜nancial controls with reference to consolidated 

˜nancial statements criteria established by 
such companies
 considering the essential components of such 
internal controls stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 

issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the ﬁGuidance Noteﬂ).
Management™s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls

The respective Company™s management and the Board of Directors are responsible for establishing and 
maintaining internal ˜nancial controls with reference to consolidated ˜nancial statements based on the criteria 

established by the respective Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in 

the Guidance Note. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate 

internal ˜nancial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and ef˜cient conduct of its 

business, including adherence to the respective company™s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention 

and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely 

preparation of reliable ˜nancial information, as required under the Act.
Auditors™ Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal ˜nancial controls with reference to consolidated 
˜nancial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and 

the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of 

internal ˜nancial controls with reference to consolidated ˜nancial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance 

Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 

assurance about whether adequate internal ˜nancial controls with reference to consolidated ˜nancial statements 

were established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal ˜nancial 
controls with reference to consolidated ˜nancial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal 

˜nancial controls with reference to consolidated ˜nancial statements included obtaining an understanding of 

internal ˜nancial controls with reference to consolidated ˜nancial statements, assessing the risk that a material 

weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of the internal controls based 

on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor™s judgement, including the assessment of 

the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated ˜nancial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We 

believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors of the 

relevant subsidiary companies, associate companies and joint venture companies (jointly controlled companies) 

in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is suf˜cient and appropriate to 

provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal ˜nancial controls with reference to consolidated ˜nancial 

statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial controls with Reference to Consolidated Financial Statements

A company's internal ˜nancial controls with reference to consolidated ˜nancial statements is a process designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of ˜nancial reporting and the preparation of ˜nancial 

statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's 

internal ˜nancial controls with reference to consolidated ˜nancial statements includes those policies and 

procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly re˚ect 

the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions 

are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of ˜nancial statements in accordance with generally accepted 

accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with 

authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 

prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could 

have a material effect on the ˜nancial statements.

Annexure to Consolidated Auditor™s Report
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial controls with Reference to consolidated Financial 
Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal ˜nancial controls with reference to consolidated ˜nancial 
statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material 

misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the 

internal ˜nancial controls with reference to consolidated ˜nancial statements to future periods are subject to 

the risk that the internal ˜nancial controls with reference to consolidated ˜nancial statements may become 

inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures 

may deteriorate.
Other Matters

Our aforesaid reports under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the 
internal ˜nancial controls with reference to consolidated ˜nancial statements in sofar as it relates to 4 subsidiary 

companies, and 2 joint venture companies (jointly controlled companies), which are companies incorporated in 

India, is based on the corresponding reports of the auditors of such companies incorporated in India.

Signi˜cant management judgment is required in determining provision for income tax, deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
and recoverability of deferred 
income tax assets. The recoverability of deferred income tax assets is based on estimates of taxable income  in which the rele
vant entity operates and the period 
over which deferred income tax assets will be recovered.

Signi˜cant accounting policies
a)
 
Basis of preparation of consolidated Financial Statements:
  
The Consolidated Financial Statements comprise the ˜nancial statements of Nilkamal Limited (ﬁthe holding 
Companyﬂ) and its subsidiaries (ﬁthe holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred as the Groupﬂ) 
and the group™s interest in joint ventures. Company have been prepared in accordance with the Indian 

Accounting Standards (Ind AS) to comply with the section 133 of the Companies Act 2013 (ﬁthe Actﬂ), and read 

with Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015 and Companies (Indian Accounting 

Standards) Rules 2016. The ˜nancial statements were authorised for issue by the Holding Company™s Board 

of Directors on 11th May 2019.
  
All the assets and liabilities have been classi˜ed as current or non current as per the Group™s normal operating 
cycle and other criteria set out in Schedule III to the Act. Based on the nature of products and the time 

between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realization in cash and cash equivalent, the Group 

has ascertained the operating cycle to be 12 months.
b)
 
Principles of Consolidation:
  
The consolidated ˜nancial statements comprise the ˜nancial statements of Nilkamal Limited (ﬁthe Holding 
Companyﬂ), its subsidiaries (the Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred as ﬁthe Groupﬂ) and 

the group™s interest in joint ventures.
 
Subsidiaries
  
Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) that are controlled by the Company. Control 
exists when the Company is exposed to, or has the ability to affect those returns through power over the 

entity. In assessing control, potential voting rights are considered only if the rights are substantive. The 

˜nancial statements of subsidiaries are included in these consolidated ˜nancial statements from the date 

that control commences until the date that control ceases. The ˜nancial statements of the Company and its 

subsidiaries have been consolidated using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events 

in similar circumstances as mentioned in those policies.
  
Upon loss of control, the Group derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any non-controlling 
interests and the other components of equity related to the subsidiary. Any surplus or de˜cit arising on the 

loss of control is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Pro˜t and Loss. If the Company retains any 

interest in the previous subsidiary, then such interest is measured at fair value at the date that control is 

lost. Subsequently, it is accounted for as an equity accounted investee depending on the level of in˚uence 

retained.
 
Joint ventures (equity accounted investees)
  
Joint arrangements are those arrangements over which the Company has joint control, established by 
contractual agreement and requiring unanimous consent for strategic ˜nancial and operating decisions. 

Investments in jointly controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method (equity accounted 

investees) and are initially recognized at cost. The carrying value of the Company™s investment includes 

goodwill identi˜ed on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The Company does not 

consolidate entities where the non-controlling interest (ﬁNCIﬂ) holders have certain signi˜cant participating 

rights that provide for effective involvement in signi˜cant decisions in the ordinary course of business of 

such entities. Investments in such entities are accounted by the equity method of accounting. When the 

Company™s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the carrying amount of that 

interest (including any long-term investments) is reduced to zero and the recognition of further losses is 

discontinued except to the extent that the Company has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of 

the investee.
 
Transactions eliminated on consolidation:
  
Intra-Group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from intra-Group 
transactions, are eliminated in full while preparing these consolidated ˜nancial statements. Unrealized gains 

or losses arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to 

the extent of the Company™s interest in the investee.
  
The ˜nancial statements of the subsidiaries and the joint ventures used for the purpose of consolidation are 
drawn upto the same reporting date as that of the Holding Company, i.e. 31 March 2019.

The consolidated ˜nancial statements have been prepared using uniform accounting policies for like 
transactions and other events in similar circumstances.
 
Historical cost convention
  
The Consolidated ˜nancial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following:

fair value;

c)
 
Use of Estimates and Judgements:
  
The preparation of consolidated ˜nancial statements in accordance with Ind AS requires use of estimates 
and assumptions for some items, which might have an effect on their recognition and measurement in the 

consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of pro˜t and loss. The actual amounts realised may 

differ from these estimates.
 
Estimates and assumptions are required in particular for:

Determination of the estimated useful lives of Property, plant and equipment
   
Useful lives of Property plant and equipment are based on the life prescribed in Schedule II of the 
Companies Act, 2013. In cases, where the useful lives are different from that prescribed in Schedule II 

for plant and machinery and dies and moulds, they are based on technical advice, taking into account 

the nature of the asset, the estimated usage of the asset, the operating conditions of the asset, past 

history of replacement, anticipated technological changes, manufacturers™ warranties and maintenance 

support.

Recognition and measurement of de˜ned bene˜t obligations
   
The obligation arising from de˜ned bene˜t plan is determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions. Key 
actuarial assumptions include discount rate, trends in salary escalation, actuarial rates and life expectancy. 
116
The discount rate is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on 
government bonds. The period to maturity of the underlying bonds correspond to the probable maturity 

of the post-employment bene˜t obligations.

Recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities
   
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences 
between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and unutilized business 

loss and depreciation carry-forwards and tax credits. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent 

that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which the deductible temporary 

differences, unused tax losses, depreciation carry-forwards and unused tax credits could be utilized.

Recognition and measurement of other provisions
   
The recognition and measurement of other provisions are based on the assessment of the probability 
of an out˚ow of resources, and on past experience and circumstances known at the balance sheet date. 

The actual out˚ow of resources at a future date may therefore vary from the amount included in other 

provisions.

Discounting of long-term ˜nancial assets / liabilities
   
All ˜nancial assets / liabilities are required to be measured at fair value on initial recognition. In case of 
˜nancial liabilities/assets which are required to subsequently be measured at amortised cost, interest is 

accrued using the effective interest method.

Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease
  
At inception of an arrangement, the Group determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease
.
   
At inception or on reassessment of an arrangement that contains a lease, the Group separates payments 
and other consideration required by the arrangement into those for the lease and those for other 

elements on the basis of their relative fair values. If the Group concludes for a ˜nance lease that it is 

impracticable to separate the payments reliably, then an asset and a liability are recognised at an amount 

equal to the fair value of the underlying asset; subsequently, the liability is reduced as payments are 

made and an imputed ˜nance cost on the liability is recognised using the Group™s incremental borrowing 

rate. And in case of operating lease, treat all payments under the arrangement as lease payments.


   
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the 
Chief operating Decision Maker. The Group prepares its segment information in conformity with the 

accounting policies adopted for preparing and presenting the consolidated ˜nancial statements of the 

Group as a whole.

Fair value of ˜nancial instruments
   
Derivatives are carried at fair value. Derivatives includes foreign currency forward contracts and interest 
rate swaps. Fair value of foreign currency forward contracts are determined using the fair value reports 

provided by respective merchant bankers. Fair value of interest rate swaps are determined with respect 

to current market rate of interest.
 
Measurement of fair values
  
The Group™s accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values for ˜nancial 
instruments.
  
The Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. The 
management regularly reviews signi˜cant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If third party 

information, such as broker quotes or pricing services, is used to measure fair values, then the management 

assesses the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion that such valuations meet 

the requirements of Ind AS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which such valuations should be 

classi˜ed.
  
When measuring the fair value of a ˜nancial asset or a ˜nancial liability, the Group uses observable market 
data as far as possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the 

inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows.
 
 
Level 1:
 
quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
  
Level 2:
 
inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, 
either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
117
  
Level 3:
 
inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable 
inputs).


value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the 
fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is signi˜cant to the entire measurement.

period during which the change has occurred.
d)
 
Standards issued but not yet ef
fective
  
On March 30, 2019, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) noti˜ed Ind AS 116, ‚Leases™ as part of the 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS)) Amendment Rules, 2019. Ind AS 116 - Leases replaces 

existing standard on leases i.e. Ind AS 17, Leases with effect from accounting periods beginning on or after 

1
st
 April 2019.
  
It eliminates the classi˜cation of leases as either ˜nance leases or operating leases for a lessee as required by 
Ind AS 17. Ind AS 116 introduces a single lessee accounting model and requires a lessee to recognise assets 

and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value.
  
A lessee is required to recognise a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset 
and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. Requirements with regard to lessor 

accounting are substantially similar to accounting requirements contained in Ind AS 17. Accordingly, a lessor 

will continue to classify its leases as operating leases or ˜nance leases, and to account for those two types of 

leases differently.
  
The Group™s operating leases primarily relate to premises, vehicles, IT equipments because all these assets 
satisfy the principle of identi˜cation and ˜xed minimum lease payments.
  
The Group proposes to adopt the above standard using modi˜ed retrospective approach, recognising the 
lease liability as the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted at the incremental borrowing 

rate and equivalent amount of right to use.
  
Based on the information currently available, the Group estimates that it will recognise a right to use asset 
of approximately 
`
 13,422.42 Lakhs and a corresponding lease liability of approx. 
`
 13,422.42 lakhs. There 
will be consequent reclassi˜cation in the cash ˚ow categories in the statement of cash ˚ows.
e)
 
Property, plant and equipment:
 
i.
 
Recognition and measurement
   
Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any 
accumulated impairment losses.
  
The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises:
  
a)
 
 
Its purchase 
price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade 
discounts and rebates.
  
b)
 
 
Any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to 
be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
  
c)
 
 
The initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing 
the item and restoring the site on 
which it is located, the obligation for which an entity incurs either when the item is acquired or as a 

consequence of having used the item during a particular period for purposes other than to produce 

inventories during that period.
   
Income and expenses related to the incidental operations, not necessary to bring the item to the location 
and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, are 

recognised in consolidated pro˜t or loss.
   
Items such as spare parts, stand-by equipments and servicing that meets the de˜nition of property, plant 
and equipment are capitalised at cost and depreciated over the useful life
   
If signi˜cant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have dif
ferent useful lives, then they are 
accounted and depreciated for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.
  
Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in pro˜t or loss.
  
Subsequent expenditure
   
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that the future economic bene˜ts associated 
with the expenditure will ˚ow to the Group.

machinery and Dies and moulds which is based on technical evaluation. Management believes that these 

useful lives best represent the period over which management expects to use these assets. Hence the 

useful life for plant and machinery of 10 years and for Dies and Moulds of 6 years for continuous running 

is different from the useful life as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013;

Individual assets except assets given on lease acquired for less than ˛ 15,000/- are depreciated entirely in the 
year of acquisition.
g)
 
Intangible Fixed Assets
  
Intangible Fixed assets, which are acquired by the Group and have ˜nite useful lives are measured at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
  
All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognised in 
pro˜t or loss as incurred.
h)
 
Amortisation
  
Software (Intangible 
assets) are amortised over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis but not 
exceeding the period of 36 months.
  
Useful life of Intangible assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted prospectively, if 
appropriate
 
i)
 
Financial Instruments
   
A ˜nancial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a ˜nancial asset of one entity and a ˜nancial 
liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial instruments also include derivative contracts 

such as foreign currency foreign exchange forward contracts and, interest rate swaps and currency 

options; and embedded derivatives in the host contract.
   
Financial instruments also covers contracts to buy or sell a non-˜nancial item that can be settled net in 
cash or another ˜nancial instrument, or by exchanging ˜nancial instruments, as if the contracts were 

˜nancial instruments, with the exception of contracts that were entered into and continue to be held 

for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of a non-˜nancial item in accordance with the entity™s expected 

purchase, sale or usage requirements.
   
Derivatives are currently recognized at fair value on the date on which the derivative contract is entered 
into and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period.
  
Cash Flow Hedges
   
The Group uses derivative ˜nancial instrument such as forward contracts and cross currency interest 
rate swaps to hedge its foreign currency risks and interest rate risks. Derivative ˜nancial instruments 

are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are 

subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as ˜nancial assets when the fair value is 

positive and as ˜nancial liabilities when the fair value is negative.
   
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to the Statement 
of Pro˜t and Loss, except for the effective portion of cash ˚ow hedge, which is recognised in Other 

Comprehensive Income and accumulated in Cash Flow
   
Hedge Reserve included in the Reserves and Surplus while any ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the Statement of Pro˜t and Loss.
119
  
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classi˜ed as:

liability.

particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability.
   
At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge 
relationship to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective 
and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identi˜cation of the hedging 

instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity 

will assess the effectiveness of changes in the hedging instrument™s fair value in offsetting the exposure 

to changes in the hedged item™s fair value or cash ˚ows attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges 

are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash ˚ows and are 

assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the 

˜nancial reporting periods for which they were designated.
   
Hedge accounting is discontinued from the last testing date when the hedging instrument expires or is 
sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer quali˜es for hedge accounting. Cumulative gain or loss on 

such hedging instrument recognised in Cash Flow Hedge Reserve is retained there until the forecasted 

transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss 

recognised in Cash Flow Hedge Reserve is transferred to consolidated statement of Pro˜t and Loss for 

the year.

  
Classi˜cation
   
The Group shall classify ˜nancial assets 
as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through 
other comprehensive income or fair value through pro˜t or loss on the basis of its business model for 

managing the ˜nancial assets and the contractual cash ˚ow characteristics of the ˜nancial asset.
  
Initial recognition and measur
ement
   
All ˜nancial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of ˜nancial assets not recorded at 
fair value through pro˜t or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the ˜nancial 

asset. Purchases or sales of ˜nancial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established 

by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, 

i.e., the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
  
Debt instruments at amortised cost
  
A 
 
‚debt instrument™ is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:
  
a)
 
 
The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual 
cash ˚ows, and
  
b)
 
 
Contractual terms 
of the asset give rise on speci˜ed dates to cash ˚ows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. After initial measurement, such 

˜nancial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) 

method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition 

and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in ˜nance 

income in the pro˜t or loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the pro˜t or loss. 

This category generally applies to trade and other receivables. For more information on receivables, 

refer to Note 47.
  
Equity investments
   
All equity investments in scope of Ind-AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are 
held for trading are classi˜ed as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Group decides to classify 

the same either as at FVOCI or FVTPL. The Group makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument 

basis. The classi˜cation is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable.
   
If the Group decides to classify an equity instrument as FVOCI, then all fair value changes on the 
instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from 

OCI to pro˜t and loss, even on sale of investment. However, the Group may transfer the cumulative gain 

or loss within equity.
   
Equity instruments 
included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes 
recognized in the pro˜t and loss.
120
  
Derecognition
   
A ˜nancial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a ˜nancial asset or part of a Group of similar ˜nancial 
assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from the Group™s balance sheet) when:


to pay the received cash ˚ows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‚pass-through™ 
arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the 

asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of 

the asset, but has transferred control of the asset
   
When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash ˚ows from an asset or has entered into a 
pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of 

ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the 

asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Group continues to recognise the transferred asset to 

the extent of the Group™s continuing involvement. In that case, the Group also recognises an associated 

liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that re˚ects the rights 

and obligations that the Group has retained.
   
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the 
lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the 

Group could be required to repay.
  
Impairment of ˜nancial assets
   
In accordance with Ind-AS 109, the Group applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and 
recognition of impairment loss on the following ˜nancial assets and credit risk exposure:
  
a)
 
 
Financial assets 
that are debt instruments, and are measured at amortised cost e.g., loans, debt 
securities, deposits, and bank balance.
  
b)
 
 
Trade receivables - The application of simpli˜ed approach does not require the Group to track 
changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each 

reporting date, right from its initial recognition. Trade receivables are tested for impairment on a 

speci˜c basis after considering the sanctioned credit limits, security like letters of credit, security 

deposit collected etc. and expectations about future cash ˚ows.

  
Classi˜cation
   
The Group classi˜es all ˜nancial liabilities as subsequently measured at amortised cost, except for 
˜nancial liabilities at fair value through pro˜t or loss. Such liabilities, including derivatives that are 

liabilities, shall be subsequently measured at fair value.
  
Initial recognition and measur
ement
   
Financial liabilities are classi˜ed, at initial recognition, as ˜nancial liabilities at fair value through pro˜t 
or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an 

effective hedge, as appropriate.
   
All ˜nancial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and 
payables, net of directly attributable and incremental transaction cost.
   
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees 
or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as ˜nance costs in the 

statement of pro˜t and loss.
   
The Group™s ˜nancial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank 
overdrafts and derivative ˜nancial instruments.
  
Derecognition
   
A ˜nancial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or 
expires. When an existing ˜nancial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially 

different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modi˜ed, such an exchange or 

modi˜cation is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. 

The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro˜t 

or loss.
121
  
Offsetting of ˜nancial instruments
   
Financial assets and ˜nancial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated 
balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there 
is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
j)
 
Valuation of Inventories:
  
Inventories of 
Raw Materials, Packing Materials, Stores and Spares, Work-in Progress, Traded goods and 
Finished goods are valued ‚at cost and net realisable value™ whichever is lower. Cost comprises all cost of 

purchase, appropriate direct production overheads and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories 

to their present location and condition. Cost formulae used is ‚Weighted Average Cost™. Due allowance is 

estimated and made for defective and obsolete items, wherever necessary, based on the past experience 

of the Group. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the 

estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Raw materials and other 

supplies held for use in the production of inventories are not written down below cost except in case where 

material prices have declined and it is estimated that the cost of the ˜nished product will exceed its net 

realisable value.
k)
 
Employee Bene˜ts:
  
All employee bene˜ts payable within twelve months of rendering the service are recognised in the period in 
which the employee renders the related service.
  
Contribution to De˜ned Contribution Plans such as Provident Fund, Employees™ State Insurance Corporation, 
etc., are charged to the consolidated Statement of Pro˜t and Loss as incurred.
actuarial valuation by an independent actuary at the end of each year, using the Projected Unit Credit 

Method. In the case of gratuity, which is funded, the fair value of the plan assets is reduced from the gross 

obligation under the de˜ned bene˜t plans, to recognise the obligation on net basis.
  
Remeasurement of net de˜ned bene˜t liability, which comprises actuarial gains and losses and the return on 
plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any excluding interest), are recognized 

immediately in other comprehensive income.
 
Other Long Term Employee Bene˜ts
 
Compensated Absences
  
Accumulated compensated absences, which are expected to be availed or encashed within 12 months from 
the end of the year end are treated as short term employee bene˜ts. The obligation towards the same is 

measured at the expected cost of accumulating compensated absences as the additional amount expected 

to be paid as a result of the unused entitlement as at the year end. Accumulated compensated absences, 

which are expected to be availed or encashed beyond 12 months from the end of the year end are treated as 

other long term employee bene˜ts. The Group™s liability is actuarially determined (using the Projected Unit 

Credit method) at the end of each year. Actuarial losses/ gains are recognised in the consolidated Statement 

of Pro˜t and Loss in the year in which they arise.
l)
 
Foreign Exchange Transactions:
  
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies of the Group at the 
exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.
  
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency 
at the exchange rate at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair 

value in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate when the fair 

value was determined. Foreign currency differences are generally recognised in pro˜t or loss. Non-monetary 

items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are not translated using the exchange 

rate at the date of the transactions.
 
Translation of ˜nancial statements of foreign entities
  
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into ˛ (Indian Rupees) at 
the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date and their statements of pro˜t and loss are translated at 

exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. For practical reasons, the group uses an average 

rate to translate income and expense items, if the average rate approximates the exchange rates at the 

dates of the transactions. The exchange differences arising on translation for consolidation are recognised 

in Foreign Currency Translation Reserve. On disposal of a foreign operation, the component of Foreign 

Currency Translation Reserve relating to that particular foreign operation is reclassi˜ed to Consolidated 

Statement of Pro˜t and Loss.
122
m)
 
Borrowing Costs:
  
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of an asset that necessarily 
takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use are capitalised as part of the cost of that 
asset till the date it is ready for its intended use or sale. Other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense 

in the period in which they are incurred.
n)
 
Revenue Recognition:
  
The Company derives revenues primarily from sale of manufactured goods, traded goods and related 
services.
  
Effective April 1, 2018, the Company has applied Ind AS 115: Revenue from Contracts with Customers which 
establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is to be 

recognised. Ind AS 115 replaces Ind AS 18 Revenue. The impact of the adoption of the standard on the 

˜nancial statements of the Company is insigni˜cant.
  
Revenue is recognised on satisfaction of performance obligation upon transfer of control of promised 
products or services to customers in an amount that re˚ects the consideration the Company expects to 

receive in exchange for those products or services. The performance obligations in our contracts are ful˜lled 

at the time of dispatch, delivery or upon formal customer acceptance depending on customer terms.
  
Revenue is measured based on transaction price which is fair value of the consideration received or receivable, 
after deduction of any discounts, sales incentives / schemes and any taxes or duties collected on behalf of the 

government such as goods and services tax, etc. Accumulated experience is used to estimate the provision 

for such discounts and sales incentives / schemes. Revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly 

probable a signi˜cant reversal will not occur.
  
The Company recognises provision for sales return, based on the historical results, measured on net basis of 
the margin of the sale. An estimate is made of goods that will be returned and a liability is recognised for 

this amount using a best estimate based on accumulated experience.
  
Dividend income is recognized in statement of pro˜t and loss only when the right to receive payment is 
established.
 
Export incentives receivable under various schemes are accounted on accrual basis.
 
Interest income is recognized using the effective interest rate method.
o)
 
Leases
 
i.
 
Lease payments
   
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in pro˜t or loss on a straight line basis over 
the term of the lease unless such payments are structured to increase in line with expected general 

in˚ation to compensate for the lessor™s expected in˚ationary cost increase. Lease incentives received are 

recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense, over the term of the lease.
   
Minimum lease payments made under ˜nance leases are apportioned between the ˜nance expense and 
the reduction of the outstanding liability. The ˜nance expense is allocated to each period during the 

lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
 
ii.
 
Lease assets
   
Assets held by the Group under leases that transfer to the Group substantially all of the risks and rewards 
of ownership are classi˜ed as ˜nance leases. The leased assets are measured initially at an amount equal 

to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to 

initial recognition, the assets are accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to 

that asset.
   
Assets held under other leases are classi˜ed as operating leases and are not recognised in the Group™s 
statement of ˜nancial position.
p)
 
Impairment of non-˜nancial assets
  
The carrying values of assets/cash generating units at each balance sheet date are reviewed for impairment 
if any indication of impairment exists. If the carrying amount of the assets exceed the estimated recoverable 

amount, an impairment is recognised for such excess amount.
  
The recoverable amount is the greater of the net selling price and their value in use. Value in use is arrived 
at by discounting the future cash ˚ows to their present value based on an appropriate discount factor.
123
  
When there 
is indication that an impairment loss recognised for an asset (other than a revalued asset) in 
earlier accounting periods which no longer exists or may have decreased, such reversal of impairment loss 
is recognised in the consolidated Statement of Pro˜t and Loss, to the extent the amount was previously 

charged to the consolidated Statement of Pro˜t and Loss. In case of revalued assets, such reversal is not 

recognised.
q)
 
Cash and cash equivalents
  
Cash and cash equivalent in the consolidated balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-
term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insigni˜cant risk of 

changes in value.
  
For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash ˚ows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and 
short-term deposits, as de˜ned above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they are considered an integral 

part of the Group™s cash management.
r)
 
Taxation:
  
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. It is recognised in pro˜t or loss except to the extent 
that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in OCI.
 
i.
 
Current tax
   
Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year 
and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. It is measured using tax 

rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Current tax also includes any tax arising 

from dividends.
  
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if, the Group:
  
a)
 
has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts; and
  
b)
 
intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
 
ii.
 
Deferred tax
   
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities for ˜nancial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax 

is not recognised for:
  
  
temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a 
business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable pro˜t or loss;
  
  
temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and associates to the extent that the 
Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable 

that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
  
 
taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
   
Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary 
differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable pro˜ts will be available against which 

they can be used. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent 

that it is no longer probable that the related tax bene˜t will be realised; such reductions are reversed 

when the probability of future taxable pro˜ts improves.
   
Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognised to the extent 
that it has become probable that future taxable pro˜ts will be available against which they can be used.
   
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when 
they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
   
The measurement of deferred tax re˚ects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in 
which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and 

liabilities.
 
 
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if:
  
a)
 
 
the entity has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities; 
and
  
b)
 
 
the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same 
taxation authority on the same taxable entity.
124
   
Deferred tax asset / liabilities in respect of on temporary differences which originate and reverse during 
the tax holiday period are not recognised. Deferred tax assets / liabilities in respect of temporary 
differences that originate during the tax holiday period but reverse after the tax holiday period are 

recognised.
s)
 
Government grants
  
Grants received from the government are recognized at their fair value where there is reasonable assurance 
that the grant will be received and the Group will comply with the conditions.
  
Government grants related to income are deferred and recognized in the pro˜t or loss over the period 
necessary to match them with the costs that they are intended to compensate and netted off with the 

expense in the consolidated statement of pro˜t and loss.
  
Government grants related to purchase of property plant and equipment are recognised as deferred income 
and are credited to pro˜t or loss on a straight line basis over expected life of the related asset and presented 

within other income.
t)
 
Provisions, Contingent Assets and Contingent Liabilities:
  
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash ˚ows speci˜c to the liability. The 
unwinding of the discount is recognised as ˜nance cost. A provision for onerous contracts is measured at 

the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of 

continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Group recognises any impairment loss on 

the assets associated with that contract.
  
A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that 
may, but will probably not, require an out˚ow of resources. When there is a possible obligation or a present 

obligation in respect of which the likelihood of out˚ow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is 

made.
  
A contingent asset is not recognised but disclosed in the consolidated ˜nancial statements where an in˚ow 
of economic bene˜t is probable.

various forums/ authorities.
2)
  
The Hon™ble Supreme Court of India (ﬁSCﬂ) by their order dated February 28, 2019, in the case of Surya Roshani

be identi˜ed for inclusion in basic wages for the purposes of computation of Provident Fund contribution. 

Subsequently, a review petition against this decision has been ˜led and is pending before the SC for disposal.

B. Measurement of fair values
     Valuation techniques and signi˜cant unobservable inputs
     
 
The following tables 
show the valuation techniques used in measuring Level 2 and Level 3 fair values, 
as well as the signi˜cant unobservable inputs used.
Financial instruments measured at fair value
Type
 Valuation technique 
Fixed rates long term borrowings
The valuation model considers present value of expected 
payments discounted using an appropriate discounting rate.
Forward contracts
The fair value is determined using forward exchange rates at 

the reporting date.
Security Deposits
The valuation model considers present value of expected 

payments discounted using an appropriate discounting rate.
Interest rate swaps
Present value of the estimated future cash ˚ows based on 

observable yield curves
C. 
 
Financial risk management
 
The Company has exposure to the following risks arising from ˜nancial instruments:
 
Credit risk ;

Liquidity risk ; and

Market risk
i. 
 
Risk management framework
 
The Group Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group 
Risk Management Policy framework. The Board of Directors have adopted an Enterprise Risk Management 

Policy framed by the Group, which identi˜es the risk and lays down the risk minimisation procedures. The 

Magement reviews the Risk Management Policies and systems on a regular basis to re˚ect changes in market 

conditions and the Group activities, and the same is reported to the Board of Directors periodically. Further, 

the Group, in order to deal with the future risks, has in place vrious methods / processes which have been 

imbibed in its organisational structure and proper internal controls are in place to keep a check on lapses, 

and the same are been modi˜ed in accordance witht th regular requirements.
131
 
The audit committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group Risk Management 
Policies and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the Risk Management framework in relation to the 
risks faced by the Group. The audit committee is assisted in its oversight role by internal auditors.
ii. 
 
Credit risk
 
Credit risk is 
the risk of ˜nancial loss to the group if a customer or counter party to a ˜nancial instrument 
fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the group™s receivables from customers 

and loans and advances.
 
The carrying amount of following ˜nancial assets represents the maximum credit exposure:
 
Trade receivables and loans and advances.
 
The group™s exposure to credit risk is in˚uenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer in 
which it operates. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously 

monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the group grants credit terms in the normal course of 

business.
 
The Risk Management Committee has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analysed 
individually for creditworthiness before the group™s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are 

offered. Further for domestic sales, the group segments the customers into Distributors and Others for credit 

monitoring.
 
The group maintains security deposits for sales made to its distributor For other trade receivables, the 
company individually monitors the sanctioned credit limits as against the outstanding balances. Accordingly, 

the group makes speci˜c provisions against such trade receivables wherever required and monitors the same 

at periodic intervals. 
 
The group monitors each loans and advances given and makes any speci˜c provision wherever required.
 
The group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect 
of trade receivables and loans and advances.

its ˜nancial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another ˜nancial asset. The Group™s approach to

when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or 

risking damage to the Group™s reputation.

iv. 
 
Market risk



is attributable to all market risk sensitive ˜nancial instruments including foreign currency receivables and 

payables and long term debt. We are exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk, 

interest rate risk and the market value of our investments. Thus, our exposure to market risk is a function of 

investing and borrowing activities and revenue generating and operating activities in foreign currency. The 

objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure in our foreign currency revenues and 

costs.
133
 
Currency risk
 
The Group is exposed to currency risk on account of its borrowings and other payables in  foreign currency. 
The functional currency of the Group is Indian Rupee (
`
). The Group uses forward exchange contracts to 
hedge its currency risk, most with a maturity of less than one year from the reporting date.
 
The currency pro˜le of ˜nancial assets and ˜nancial liabilities as at 31

Sensitivity analysis
A reasonably possible strengthening (weakening) of the Foreign Currency  against the Indian Rupee (
`
) 
at 31st March would have affected the measurement of ˜nancial instruments denominated in foreign 

currencies and affected equity and pro˜t or loss by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that 

all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant and ignores any impact of forecast sales 

and purchases.

Interest rate risk:
 
Interest rate risk can be either fair value interest rate risk or cash ˚ow interest rate risk. Fair value interest 
rate risk is the risk of changes in fair values of ˜xed interest bearing investments because of ˚uctuations in 

the interest rates. Cash ˚ow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash ˚ows of ˚oating interest bearing 

investments will ˚uctuate because of ˚uctuations in the interest rates. 
134
 
Exposure to inter
est rate risk
 
Company™s 
interest rate risk arises from borrowings. The interest rate pro˜le of the Company™s interest-
bearing ˜nancial instruments as reported to the management of the Company is as follows.

Fair value sensitivity analysis for ˜xed-rate instruments
 
The Group does 
not account for any ˜xed-rate ˜nancial assets or ˜nancial liabilities at fair value through 
pro˜t or loss. Therefore, a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect pro˜t or loss.
 
The Group manages its cash ˚ow interest rate risk by using ˚oating-to-˜xed interest rate swaps. Under 
theses swaps, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange, the difference between ˜xed contract rates 
and ˚oating rates interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional principal amounts.
 
Cash ˚ow sensitivity analysis for variable-rate instruments
 
A reasonably possible change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased 
(decreased) pro˜t or loss by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in 

particular foreign currency exchange rates, remain constant.

The risk estimates provided assume a parallel shift of 100 basis points interest rate across all yield curves. This 
calculation also assumes that the change occurs at the balance sheet date and has been calculated based on 

risk exposures outstanding as at that date. The period end balances are not necessarily representative of the 

average debt outstanding during the period.

Hedge accounting
 
The Group™s risk management policy is to hedge  its estimated foreign currency exposure in respect of highly 
probable forecast purchases and foreign currency borrowings. The Holding Company uses forward exchange 

contracts to hedge its currency risk and cross currency interest rate swap to hedge its interest rate and 

currency risk related to foreign currency borrowings. Such contracts are generally designated as cash ˚ow 

hedges.
 
The Holding Company determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging 
instrument and hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash ˚ows. The 

Company assesses whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be and has 

been effective in offsetting changes in the cash ˚ows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative 

method.
