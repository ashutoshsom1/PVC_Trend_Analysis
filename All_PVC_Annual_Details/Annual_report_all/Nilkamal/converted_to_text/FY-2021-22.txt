Independent Auditor™s Report
To the Members of

Nilkamal Limited

Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the standalone financial statements of Nilkamal Limited (ﬁthe Companyﬂ), which comprise the 
standalone balance sheet as at 31 March 2022, and the standalone statement of profit and loss (including other 
comprehensive income), standalone statement of changes in equity and standalone statement of cash flows for 
the year then ended, and notes to the standalone financial statements, including a summary of the significant 
accounting policies and other explanatory information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone 
financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (ﬁActﬂ) in the manner so required and 

give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs 
of the Company as at 31 March 2022, and profit and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and its cash flows 
for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the 
Act. Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the Auditor™s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 

Standalone Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the 

Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are 

relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, 

and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. 

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on 

the Standalone financial statements.
Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the 

standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate 

opinion on these matters.
Description of Key Audit Matter
Revenue Recognition 
How the matter was addressed in our audit
Refer Note 36(m) of significant accounting policies 
and Note 33 in the standalone financial statements.
Revenue of the Company comprises of sale of varied 
products related to material handling, plastic moulded 

products and mattresses through different channels 

of sales with varied customers at different contractual 

price points and terms; and sale of furniture through 

its retail outlets.  
The Company recognises revenue from sale of goods 
when control of the goods has been transferred and 

when there are no longer any unfulfilled obligations 
to the customer and the amount of revenue can be 
measured reliably and recovery of the consideration 
is probable.  
The Company focuses on revenue as a key performance 
measure which could create incentive for revenue to 

be recognised even with any of the above conditions 

not being met.  
Considering the above focus of the Company, the 
volume of transactions, cash collections at the retail 

store that need to be deposited in bank and the 

number of locations across India, we have identified 

existence and completeness of revenue from sale of 

products as a key audit matter. 
In view of the significance of the matter we applied the 

following audit procedures in this area, among others to 

obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence:
Œ
 
Evaluating the Company™s accounting policies for revenue 

recognition, in terms of applicable accounting standards. 
Œ
 
Testing the design, implementation and operating 

effectiveness of the Company™s general IT controls and 

Key IT/manual controls. These are in respect of the 

Company™s controls which govern timing of recognition 

of revenue including creation of new customers in system.
Œ
 
Tested, by selecting statistical samples, underlying 

documentation and records i.e. invoices, acknowledge 

delivered receipts and collection receipts for sales 

transactions recorded throughout the year and at year 

end to determine the existence of revenue.
Œ
 
Tested, by selecting statistical samples, the underlying 

documentation related to credit notes such as invoices 

and approval of sales return. 
Œ
 
Performing cut - off procedures at year end by verifying 

underlying invoices, acknowledge delivered receipts, 

the transit time to deliver the goods and its revenue 

recognition.
Œ
 
Analysis of one-off sales made to customers.
Œ
 
Testing, by selecting statistical samples, of Daily Cash 

Report and checking the deposit of daily cash received 

in bank.

Information Other than the Standalone Financial Statements and Auditors™ Report Thereon
The Company™s management and Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information 
comprises the information included in the Company™s annual report, but does not include the financial statements and 

our auditors™ report thereon.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial 

statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the 

work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required 

to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Management™s and Board of Directors™ Responsibility for the Standalone Financial Statements

The Company™s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the 
Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the 

state of affairs, profit/loss and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in 

accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind 

AS) specified under section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting 

records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for 

preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; 

making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance 

of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring accuracy and completeness of the 

accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true 

and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, the Management and Board of Directors are responsible for assessing 
the Company™s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to 
cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Company™s financial reporting process.
Auditor™s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone
 
Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
 
or error, and to issue an auditor™s report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:

or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 

fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 

misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

opinion on whether the company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in 

place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
related disclosures in the standalone financial statements made by the Management and Board of Directors.

accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events 
or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company™s ability to continue as a going concern. If we 

conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor™s report to the related 

disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 

Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor™s report. However, future 

events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

manner that achieves fair presentation.
Independent Auditors™ Report
63
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing 
of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify 

during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may 

reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit 

matters. We describe these matters in our auditors™ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about 

the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our 
report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication.

Annexure B to the Independent Auditors™ report on the standalone ˜nancial statements of Nilkamal 

Limited for the period ended 31 March 2022.
Report on the internal ˜nancial controls with reference to the aforesaid standalone ˜nancial 
statements under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013
(Referred to in paragraph 2(A)(f) under ‚Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements™ section 
of our report of even date)
Opinion
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements of Nilkamal Limited (ﬁthe 
Companyﬂ) as of 31 March 2022 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the Company 
for the year ended on that date.
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements and such internal financial controls were operating effectively as at 31 March 2022, based on the internal 
financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements criteria established by the Company considering 
the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 

Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the ﬁGuidance Noteﬂ).

Annexure to Auditors™ Report
Management™s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The Company™s management and the Board of Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal 
financial controls based on the internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements criteria 
established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note. 

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to 
company™s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under 

the Companies Act, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as ﬁthe Actﬂ).
Auditors™ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company™s internal financial controls with reference to standalone 
financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the 

Standards on Auditing, prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal 
financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require 
that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements were established and 

maintained and whether such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls with reference to standalone financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal 

financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements included obtaining an understanding of such 

internal financial controls, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and 

operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor™s 

judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, 

whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Company™s internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial controls with Reference to Standalone Financial Statements

A company™s internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of standalone 

financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company™s 

internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements include those policies and procedures 

that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions 

and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as 

necessary to permit preparation of standalone financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting 

principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations 

of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely 

detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company™s assets that could have a material effect on 

the standalone financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial controls with Reference to Standalone Financial Statements

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements, 
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to 

error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with 

reference to standalone financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls 

with reference to standalone financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that 

the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The  Company offsets tax assets and liabilities if and only if it has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and current tax liabilities and the 
deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority.

Management judgment is required in determining provision for income tax, deferred income tax assets and liabilities and recoverability of deferred income 

tax assets. The recoverability of deferred income tax assets is based on estimates of taxable income  in which the relevant entity operates and the period over 

which deferred income tax assets will be recovered.
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements

Signi˜cant accounting policies
 
a)
 
Basis of preparation of Financial Statements:
   
The Financial Statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting 
Standards (Ind AS) to comply with the section 133 of the Companies Act 2013(ﬁthe 2013 Actﬂ), read with Rule 

3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, and Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 

Rules, 2016. The financial statements were authorised for issue by the Company™s Board of Directors on 23
rd
 
May 2022.
   
All the assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-current as per the Company™s normal operating 
cycle and other criteria set out in Schedule III to the Act. Based on the nature of products and the time between 
the acquisition of assets for processing and their realization in cash and cash equivalent, the Company has 
ascertained the operating cycle to be 12 months.
  
Functional and presentation currency:
   
These standalone financial statements are presented in Indian rupees, which is the Company™s functional 

currency. All amounts have been rounded off to two decimal places to the nearest lakh, unless otherwise 

indicated.
  
Historical cost convention:
  
The standalone financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following:



 
b)
 
Use of Estimates and Judgements:
   
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with Ind AS requires use of estimates and assumptions 
for some items, which might have an effect on their recognition and measurement in the balance sheet and 
statement of profit and loss. The actual amounts realised may differ from these estimates.
  
Estimates and assumptions are required in particular for:


    
Useful lives of property plant and equipment are based on the life prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies 
Act, 2013. In cases, where the useful lives are different from that prescribed in Schedule II for plant and 

machinery and dies and moulds, they are based on technical advice, taking into account the nature of the 

asset, the estimated usage of the asset, the operating conditions of the asset, past history of replacement, 

anticipated technological changes, manufacturers™ warranties and maintenance support.
  


    
The obligation arising from defined benefit plan is determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions. Key 
actuarial assumptions include discount rate, trends in salary escalation, actuarial rates and life expectancy. 

The discount rate is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on 

government bonds. The period to maturity of the underlying bonds correspond to the probable maturity 

of the post-employment benefit obligations.


    
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences 
between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and unutilized business 

loss and depreciation carry-forwards and tax credits. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent 

that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which the deductible temporary 

differences, unused tax losses, depreciation carry-forwards and unused tax credits could be utilized.



    
The recognition and measurement of other provisions are based on the assessment of the probability of 
an outflow of resources, and on past experience and circumstances known at the balance sheet date. 
The actual outflow of resources at a future date may therefore vary from the amount included in other 
provisions.

    
All financial assets / liabilities are required to be measured at fair value on initial recognition. In case of 
financial liabilities / assets which are required to subsequently be measured at amortised cost, interest is 

accrued using the effective interest method.
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the 
Chief Operating Decision Maker. The Company prepares its segment information in conformity with the 

accounting policies adopted for preparing and presenting the financial statements of the Company as a 

whole.

    
Derivatives are carried at fair value. Derivatives includes foreign currency forward contracts and interest 
rate swaps. Fair value of foreign currency forward contracts are determined using the fair value reports 

provided by respective bankers. Fair value of interest rate swaps are determined with respect to current 

market rate of interest.
  

    
The Company™s accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values for financial 
instruments.
    
The Company has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. The 
management regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If third party 
information, such as broker quotes or pricing services, is used to measure fair values, then the management 
assesses the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion that such valuations meet 

the requirements of Ind AS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which such valuations should 

be classified.
    
When measuring the fair value of a financial asset or a financial liability, the Company uses observable 
market data as far as possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy 
based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows.

 
quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).


 
inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable 
inputs).
    
If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value 
hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value 

hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.

Standards issued but not yet effective
e
   
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (ﬁMCAﬂ) notifies new standard or amendments to the existing standards under 

Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. On March 23, 2022, MCA amended 

the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2022, applicable from April 1st, 2022, as 

below:
  
i.
  
Ind AS 103 Œ Reference to Conceptual Framework - The amendments specify that to qualify for recognition 
as part of applying the acquisition method, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed must 
meet the definitions of assets and liabilities in the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting under 
Indian Accounting Standards (Conceptual Framework) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India at the acquisition date. These changes do not significantly change the requirements of Ind AS 103.
  
ii.
  
Ind AS 16 Œ Proceeds before intended use - The amendments mainly prohibit an entity from deducting 
from the cost of property, plant and equipment amounts received from selling items produced while the 
company is preparing the asset for its intended use. Instead, an entity will recognise such sales proceeds 
and related cost in profit or loss.
  
iii.
  
Ind AS 37 Œ Onerous Contracts - Costs of Fulfilling a Contract - The amendments specify that that the ‚cost 
of fulfilling™ a contract comprises the ‚costs that relate directly to the contract™. Costs that relate directly 

to a contract can either be incremental costs of fulfilling that contract (examples would be direct labour, 

materials) or an allocation of other costs that relate directly to fulfilling contracts.
  
iv.
  
Ind AS 109 Œ Annual Improvements to Ind AS (2021) - The amendment clarifies which fees an entity 

includes when it applies the ‚10 percent™ test of Ind AS 109 in assessing whether to derecognise a financial 

liability.
  
v.
  
Ind AS 116 Œ Annual Improvements to Ind AS (2021) - The amendments remove the illustration of the 

reimbursement of leasehold improvements by the lessor in order to resolve any potential confusion 
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements
94
regarding the treatment of lease incentives that might arise because of how lease incentives were described 
in that illustration. The Company is assessing the impact of these changes and will accordingly incorporate 

the same in the financial statements for the year ending March 2023.
 
d)
 
Property, plant and equipment:


    
Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any 
accumulated impairment losses.
   
The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises:
    
Its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade 

discounts and rebates.
    
Any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be 

capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
    
The initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is 

located, the obligation for which an entity incurs either when the item is acquired or as a consequence of 

having used the item during a particular period for purposes other than to produce inventories during that 

period.
    
Income and expenses related to the incidental operations, not necessary to bring the item to the location 

and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, are 

recognised in profit or loss.
    
Items such as spare parts, stand-by equipments and servicing that meets the definition of property, plant 

and equipment are capitalised at cost and depreciated over the useful life.
    
If significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, then they are 

accounted and depreciated for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.
   
Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in profit or loss.
    
Capital work in progress is stated at cost and includes the cost of the assets that are not ready for their 
intended use at the Balance Sheet date.


    
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated 
with the expenditure will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
 
e)
 
Depreciation:

lives of assets as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 except for plant and 
machinery and Dies and moulds which is based on technical evaluation. Management believes that these 

useful lives best represent the period over which management expects to use these assets. Hence the 

useful life for plant and machinery of 10 years and for Dies and Moulds of 6 years for continuous running 

is different from the useful life as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013;
    
Useful life of property plant and equipment are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted 

prospectively, if appropriate.


of such addition or upto the date of such sale/discardment, as the case may be;


acquisition;



` 
15,000/- are depreciated entirely in 
the year of acquisition.
 
f)
 
Intangible Fixed Assets :
   
Intangible assets, which are acquired by the Company and have finite useful lives are measured at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
   
All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognised in 

profit or loss as incurred.
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements
95
 
g)
 
Amortisation:
   
Software (Intangible assets) are amortised over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis but not 
exceeding the period of 36 months.
   
Useful life of Intangible assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted prospectively, if 

appropriate.
 
h)
 
Financial Instruments:
   
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability 
or equity instrument of another entity. Financial instruments also include derivative contracts such as foreign 
currency foreign exchange forward contracts and, interest rate swaps and currency options; and embedded 

derivatives in the host contract.
   
Financial instruments also covers contracts to buy or sell a non-financial item that can be settled net in cash 

or another financial instrument, or by exchanging financial instruments, as if the contracts were financial 

instruments, with the exception of contracts that were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of 

the receipt or delivery of a non-financial item in accordance with the entity™s expected purchase, sale or usage 

requirements.
   
Derivatives are currently recognized at fair value on the date on which the derivative contract is entered into 

and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period.
  
Cash Flow Hedges
   
The Company uses derivative financial instrument such as forward contracts and cross currency interest rate 

swaps to hedge its foreign currency risks and interest rate risks. Derivative financial instruments are initially 

recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 

remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as 

financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.
   
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to the Statement of 
Profit and Loss, except for the effective portion of cash flow hedge, which is recognised in Other Comprehensive 
Income and accumulated in Cash Flow Hedge Reserve included in the Reserves and Surplus while any ineffective 
portion is recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
  
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as:
  
Fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability.
   
Cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to particular risk 

associated with a recognised asset or liability.
   
At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Company formally designates and documents the hedge 

relationship to which the Company wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and 

strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the 

hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the effectiveness 

of changes in the hedging instrument™s fair value in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item™s 

fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in 

achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine 

that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were 

designated.
   
Hedge accounting is discontinued from the last testing date when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 

terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Cumulative gain or loss on such hedging 

instrument recognised in Cash Flow Hedge Reserve is retained there until the forecasted transaction occurs. If 

a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in Cash Flow 

Hedge Reserve is transferred to Statement of Profit and Loss for the year.
  
Financial Assets
  
Classification
   
The Company shall classify financial assets as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through 
other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss on the basis of its business model for managing 
the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.
  
Initial recognition and measurement
   
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at 

fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial 
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements
96
asset. Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by 
regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the 

date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.
  
Debt instruments at amortised cost
  
A ‚debt instrument™ is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:
  
a)
  
The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash 
flows, and
  
b)
  
Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of 

principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.
   
After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on 
acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in finance 

income in the profit or loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the profit or loss. This category 

generally applies to trade and other receivables. For more information on receivables, refer to Note 49.
  
Equity investments
   
All equity investments in scope of Ind-AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for 
trading are classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Company decides to classify the same 

either as at FVOCI or FVTPL. The Company makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The 

classification is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable.
   
If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as FVOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, 

excluding dividends, are recognized in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to profit and loss, 

even on sale of investment. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.
   
Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized 
in the profit and loss.
  
Derecognition
   
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a Company of similar financial 
assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from the Company™s balance sheet) when:


to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‚pass-through™ 
arrangement; and either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the 

asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the 

asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
   
When the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-

through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. 

When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor 

transferred control of the asset, the Company continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of 

the Company™s continuing involvement. In that case, the Company also recognises an associated liability. The 

transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations 

that the Company has retained.
   
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower 

of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Company 

could be required to repay.
  
Impairment of ˜nancial assets
   
In accordance with Ind-AS 109, the Company applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and 

recognition of impairment loss on the following financial assets and credit risk exposure:
  
a)
  
Financial assets that are debt instruments, and are measured at amortised cost e.g., loans, debt securities, 

deposits, and bank balance.
  
b)
  
Trade receivables - The application of simplified approach does not require the Company to track changes 

in credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting 

date, right from its initial recognition. Trade receivables are tested for impairment on a specific basis after 

considering the sanctioned credit limits, security like letters of credit, security deposit collected etc. and 

expectations about future cash flows.
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements
97
  
Financial liabilities
  
Classi˜cation

   
The Company classifies all financial liabilities as subsequently measured at amortised cost, except for financial 
liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Such liabilities, including derivatives that are liabilities, shall be 

subsequently measured at fair value.
  
Initial recognition and measurement
   
Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, 
loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as 
appropriate.
   
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, 
net of directly attributable and incremental transaction cost.
   
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs 
that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of profit 
and loss.
   
The Company™s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank 
overdrafts and derivative financial instruments.
  
Derecognition
   
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. 
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, 

or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as 

the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective 

carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
  
Offsetting of ˜nancial instruments
   
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if there 

is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a 

net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
 
i)
 
Valuation of Inventories:
   
Inventories of Raw Materials, Packing Materials, Stores and Spares, Work-in Progress, Traded goods and 

Finished goods are valued ‚at cost and net realisable value™ whichever is lower. Cost comprises all cost of 

purchase, appropriate direct production overheads and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their 

present location and condition. Cost formulae used is ‚Weighted Average Cost™. Due allowance is estimated 

and made for defective and obsolete items, wherever necessary, based on the past experience of the Company. 

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of 

completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Raw materials and other supplies held for use 

in the production of inventories are not written down below cost except in case where material prices have 

declined and it is estimated that the cost of the finished product will exceed its net realisable value.
 
j)
 
Employee Benefits:
  
Short Term Employee Bene˜ts
   
All employee benefits payable within twelve months of rendering the service are recognised in the period in 

which the employee renders the related service.
  
Post Employment / Retirement Bene˜ts
   
Contribution to Defined Contribution Plans such as Provident Fund, Employees™ State Insurance Corporation, 

etc., are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss as incurred.
   
Defined Benefit Plans Œ The present value of the obligation under such plans is determined based on an 

actuarial valuation by an independent actuary at the end of each year, using the Projected Unit Credit Method. 

In the case of gratuity, which is funded, the fair value of the plan assets is reduced from the gross obligation 

under the defined benefit plans, to recognise the obligation on net basis.
   
Remeasurement of net defined benefit liability, which comprises actuarial gains and losses and the return on 

plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any excluding interest), are recognized 

immediately in other comprehensive income.
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements
98
  
Other Long Term Employee Bene˜ts
  
Compensated Absences

   
Accumulated compensated absences, which are expected to be availed or encashed within 12 months from the 
end of the year-end are treated as short term employee benefits. The obligation towards the same is measured 

at the expected cost of accumulating compensated absences as the additional amount expected to be paid as 

a result of the unused entitlement as at the year-end. Accumulated compensated absences, which are expected 
to be availed or encashed beyond 12 months from the end of the year-end are treated as other long-term 
employee benefits. The Company™s liability is actuarially determined (using the Projected Unit Credit method) 

at the end of each year. Actuarial losses/ gains are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the year 

in which they arise.
 
k)
 
Foreign Exchange Transactions:
   
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies of the Company at 

the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.
   
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency 

at the exchange rate at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value 

in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate when the fair value was 

determined. Foreign currency differences are generally recognised in profit or loss. Non-monetary items that 

are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the 

date of the transaction.
 
l)
 
Borrowing Costs:
   
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of an asset that necessarily 
takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use are capitalised as part of the cost of that 
asset till the date it is ready for its intended use or sale. Other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in 

the period in which they are incurred.
 
m)
 
Revenue Recognition:
  
The Company derives revenues primarily from sale of manufactured goods, traded goods and related services.
   
Revenue is recognised on satisfaction of performance obligation upon transfer of control of promised products 

or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in 

exchange for those products or services. The performance obligations in our contracts are fulfilled at the time 

of dispatch, delivery or upon formal customer acceptance depending on customer terms.
   
Revenue is measured based on transaction price which is fair value of the consideration received or receivable, 

after deduction of any discounts, sales incentives / schemes and any taxes or duties collected on behalf of the 

government such as goods and services tax, etc. Accumulated experience is used to estimate the provision for 

such discounts and sales incentives / schemes. Revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable 

a significant reversal will not occur.
   
Dividend income is recognized in statement of profit and loss only when the right to receive payment is 

established.
   
Export incentives receivable under various schemes are accounted on accrual basis.
  
Interest income is recognized using the effective interest rate method.
 
n)
 
Leases:
   
At the inception it is assessed, whether a contract is a lease or contains a lease. A contract is a lease or contains 

a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, for a period of time, in exchange for 

consideration.
   
To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, Company assesses 

whether the contract involves the use of an identified asset. Use may be specified explicitly or implicitly.




the period of use

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements
99


when Company has the right to use the asset or Company designed the asset in a way that predetermines 
how and for what purpose it will be used.
   
At the commencement or modification of a contract, that contains a lease component, Company allocates 

the consideration in the contract, to each lease component, on the basis of its relative standalone prices. For 
leases of property, it is elected not to separate non-lease components and account for the lease and non-lease 
components as a single lease component.
  
As a Lessee:
  
Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date.
  
Right-of-use asset (ROU):
   
The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost. Cost comprises of the initial amount of the lease liability 
adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, any initial direct costs incurred 
by the lessee, an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying 
asset or the site on which it is located less any lease incentives received.
   
After the commencement date, a lessee shall measure the right-of-use asset applying cost model, which is Cost 
less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses and also adjusted for certain re-
measurements of the lease liability.
   
Right-of-use asset is depreciated using straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the 
lease term. If the lease transfers the ownership of the underlying asset to the Company at the end of the 
lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects Company will exercise the purchase option, ROU will 
be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset, which is determined based on the same basis as 
property, plant and equipment.
  
Lease liability:
   
Lease liability is initially measured at the present value of lease payments that are not paid at the commencement 
date. Discounting is done using the implicit interest rate in the lease, if that rate cannot be readily determined, 

then using Company™s incremental borrowing rate. Incremental borrowing rate is determined based on entity™s 

borrowing rate adjusted for terms of the lease and type of the asset leased.
   
Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprises of fixed payments (including in 

substance fixed payments), variable lease payments that depends on an index or a rate, initially measured 

using the index or rate at the commencement date, amount expected to be payable under a residual value 

guarantee, the exercise price under a purchase option that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, lease 

payments in an optional renewal period if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, 

and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Company is reasonably certain not to terminate early.
   
Lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Lease liability is re-measured 

when there is a change in the lease term, a
 
change in its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, 
extension or termination option or a revised in-substance fixed lease payment, a
 
change in the amounts 
expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee and a change in future lease payments arising from 

change in an index or rate.
   
When the lease liability is re-measured, corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-

of-use asset. If the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero it will be recorded in 

statement of profit and loss.
   
Right-of-use asset is presented under ﬁProperty Plant and Equipmentﬂ and lease liabilities are presented under 

ﬁFinancial liabilitiesﬂ in the balance sheet.
   
Company has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases. The lease 

payments associated with these leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
  
Lessor
   
At the commencement or modification of a contract, that contains a lease component, Company allocates the 
consideration in the contract, to each lease component, on the basis of its relative standalone prices.
   
At the inception of the lease, it is determined whether it is a finance lease or an operating lease. If the lease 

transfers
 
substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset, then it is a 
financial lease, otherwise it is an operating lease.
   
If the lease arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, then the consideration in the contract is 

allocated using the principles of IND AS 115. The Company tests for the impairment losses at the year end. 
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements
100
Payment received under operating lease is recognised as income on straight line basis, over the lease term.
   
The accounting policies applicable to the Company as a lessor, in the comparative period, were not different 
from IND AS 116.
 
o)
 
Impairment of non-financial assets
   
The carrying values of assets/cash generating units at each balance sheet date are reviewed for impairment 
if any indication of impairment exists. If the carrying amount of the assets exceed the estimated recoverable 
amount, an impairment is recognised for such excess amount.
   
The recoverable amount is the greater of the net selling price and their value in use. Value in use is arrived at 

by discounting the future cash flows to their present value based on an appropriate discount factor.
   
When there is indication that an impairment loss recognised for an asset (other than a revalued asset) in 
earlier accounting periods which no longer exists or may have decreased, such reversal of impairment loss 
is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss, to the extent the amount was previously charged to the 

Statement of Profit and Loss. In case of revalued assets, such reversal is not recognised.
 
p)
 
Cash and cash equivalents
   
Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits 

with remaining maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
   
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term 

deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they are considered an integral part of the 

Company™s cash management.
 
q)
 
Taxation:
   
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. It is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent 
that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in OCI.
  
i)
 
Current tax
    
Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year 
and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. It is measured using tax 

rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Current tax also includes any tax arising from 

dividends.
   
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if, the Company:
   
a)
 
 has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts; and
   
b)
 
intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
   
Uncertain Tax position:
    
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which 
applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. 
The provision is estimated based on one of two methods, the expected value method (the sum of the 
probability weighted amounts in a range of possible outcomes) or the single most likely amount method, 
depending on which is expected to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty.
  
ii)
 
Deferred tax
    
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not 

recognised for:

business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;


Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable 
that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and

    
Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary 
differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available, against which they 

can be used. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that 
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements
101
it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised; such reductions are reversed when the 
probability of future taxable profits improves.
    
Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognised to the extent that 

it has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used.
    
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when 

they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
    
The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in 

which the Company expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets 
and liabilities.
   
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if:
   
a)
 
The entity has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities; and
   
b)
  
The deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same 
taxation authority on the same taxable entity.
    
Deferred tax asset / liabilities in respect of on temporary differences, which originate and reverse during the 

tax holiday period are not recognised. Deferred tax assets / liabilities in respect of temporary differences 

that originate during the tax holiday period but reverse after the tax holiday period are recognised.
 
r)
 
Government Grants:
   
Grants received from the government are recognized at their fair value where there is reasonable assurance 
that the grant will be received and the Company will comply with the conditions.
   
Government grants related to income are deferred and recognized in the profit or loss over the period necessary 

to match them with the costs that they are intended to compensate and netted off with the expense in the 
statement of profit and loss.
   
Government grants related to purchase of property plant and equipment are recognised by deducting the 
grant from the carrying amount of the property plant and equipment in which case the grant is recognised in 

profit or loss as a reduction of depreciation charged.

Provisions, Contingent Assets and Contingent Liabilities:
   
A provision is recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a 

past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to 

settle the obligation, in respect of which a reliable estimate can be made. These are reviewed at each balance 

sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current management estimates.
   
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected 

future cash flows specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost.
   
Contingent Liabilities are disclosed in respect of possible obligations that arise from past events, but their 

existence is confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly 

within the control of the Company.
   
A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the 

occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity.
 

Contingent Assets are not recognised till the realization of the income is virtually certain. However, the same 

are disclosed in the financial statements where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.
 
t)
 
Earnings per share
   
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit for the period attributable to the equity 
shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. 
The weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period and for all periods presented 
is adjusted for events, such as bonus shares, other than the conversion of potential equity shares that have 
changed the number of equity shares outstanding, without a corresponding change in resources.
   
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit for the period attributable to equity 

shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period is adjusted for the 

effects of all dilutive potential equity shares.

Financial risk management
 
The Company has exposure to the following risks arising from financial instruments:





i.
 
Risk management framework
  
The Company™s Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company™s 
Risk Management framework. The Board of Directors have adopted an Enterprise Risk Management Policy framed 

by the Company, which identifies the risk and lays down the risk minimization procedures. The Management 

reviews the Risk management policies and systems on a regular basis to reflect changes in market conditions and 

the Company™s activities, and the same is reported to the Board of Directors periodically. Further, the Company, 

in order to deal with the future risks, has in place various methods / processes which have been imbibed in its 

organizational structure and proper internal controls are in place to keep a check on lapses, and the same are been 

modified in accordance with the regular requirements.
  
The Audit Committee oversees how Management monitors compliance with the Company™s Risk Management 

policies and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced 

by the Company. The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by the internal auditors.
ii.
 
Credit risk
  
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails 

to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company™s receivables from customers and 

loans and advances.
 
The carrying amount of following financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure:
 
Trade receivables and loans and advances.
  
The Company™s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer in 
which it operates. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously 
monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of 
business.
  
The Risk Management Committee has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analysed 
individually for creditworthiness before the Company™s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are 
offered. Further for domestic sales, the company segments the customers into Distributors and Others for credit 
monitoring.
  
The Company maintains security deposits for sales made to its distributors. For other trade receivables, the 
company individually monitors the sanctioned credit limits as against the outstanding balances. Accordingly, the 

Company makes specific provisions against such trade receivables wherever required and monitors the same at 
periodic intervals.
 
The Company monitors each loans and advances given and makes any specific provision wherever required.
  
The Company establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect 
of trade receivables and loans and advances.

iii.
 
Liquidity risk

iv.
 
Market risk
  
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices Œ such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity 

prices Œ will affect the Company™s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. Market risk is 

attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including foreign currency receivables and payables 

and long term debt. We are exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk, interest rate 

risk and the market value of our investments. Thus, our exposure to market risk is a function of investing and 

borrowing activities and revenue generating and operating activities in foreign currency. The objective of market 

risk management is to avoid excessive exposure in our foreign currency revenues and costs.
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements
113
 
Currency risk
  
The Company is exposed to currency risk on account of its borrowings and other payables in  foreign currency. 
The functional currency of the Company is Indian Rupee. The Company uses forward exchange contracts to 

hedge its currency risk, most with a maturity of less than one year from the reporting date.

Interest rate risk
  
Interest rate risk can be either fair value interest rate risk or cash flow interest rate risk. Fair value interest rate 
risk is the risk of changes in fair values of fixed interest bearing investments because of fluctuations in the interest 

rates. Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of floating interest bearing investments will 
fluctuate because of fluctuations in the interest rates.
 
Exposure to interest rate risk
  
Company™s interest rate risk arises from borrowings. The interest rate profile of the Company™s interest-bearing 
financial instruments as reported to the management of the Company is as follows.

The risk estimates provided assume a parallel shift of 100 basis points interest rate across all yield curves. This 
calculation also assumes that the change occurs at the balance sheet date and has been calculated based on risk 

exposures outstanding as at that date. The period end balances are not necessarily representative of the average 

debt outstanding during the period.

Hedge accounting
  
The Company™s risk management policy is to hedge  its estimated foreign currency exposure in respect of highly 
probable forecast purchases and foreign currency borrowings. The Company uses forward exchange contracts to 

hedge its currency risk and cross currency interest rate swap to hedge its interest rate and currency risk related 

to foreign currency borrowings. Such contracts are generally designated as cash flow hedges.
  
The Company determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged 

item based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash flows. The Company assesses whether the 

derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be and has been effective in offsetting changes 

in the cash flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method.

Consolidated Auditors™ Report
Independent Auditor™s Report
To the Members of Nilkamal Limited
Report on the Audit of Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Nilkamal Limited (hereinafter referred to as the ‚Holding 
Companyﬂ) and its subsidiaries (Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as ﬁthe Groupﬂ) and its 
joint venture, which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 March 2022, and the consolidated statement 

of profit and loss (including other comprehensive income), consolidated statement of changes in equity and 

consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, 

including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as 

ﬁthe consolidated financial statementsﬂ).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, and based on the 
consideration of reports of other auditors on separate/consolidated financial statements of such subsidiaries and joint 
venture as were audited by the other auditors, the aforesaid consolidated financial statements give the information 
required by the Companies Act, 2013 (ﬁActﬂ) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity 

with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group and its joint 

venture as at 31 March 2022, of its consolidated profit and other comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity 
and consolidated cash flows for the year then ended.
Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the 
Act. Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the Auditor™s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group and its joint venture in 
accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in 
terms of the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the relevant provisions of the 
Act, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the 
audit evidence obtained by us along with the consideration of audit reports of the other auditors referred to in sub 
paragraph (a) of the ﬁOther Mattersﬂ paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion 
on the consolidated financial statements.
Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters.
Description of Key Audit Matter
Revenue Recognition
How the matter was addressed in our audit
Refer Note 36(o) of significant accounting policies 
and Note 33 in the consolidated financial statements.
Revenue of the Company comprises of sale of 

varied products related to material handling, plastic 

moulded products and mattresses through different 

channels of sales with varied customers at different 

contractual price points and terms; and sale of 

furniture through its retail outlets.
The Company recognises revenue from sale of goods 
when control of the goods has been transferred and 

when there are no longer any unfulfilled obligations 

to the customer and the amount of revenue can be 

measured reliably and recovery of the consideration 

is probable.
The Company focuses on revenue as a key 
performance measure which could create incentive 

for revenue to be recognised even with any of the 

above conditions not being met.
Considering the above focus of the Company, the 
volume of transactions, cash collections at the retail 

store that need to be deposited in bank and the 

number of locations across India, we have identified 

existence and completeness of revenue from sale of 

products as a key audit matter.
In view of the significance of the matter we applied the following 

audit procedures in this area, among others to obtain sufficient 

appropriate audit evidence:
-
  
Evaluating the Company™s accounting policies for revenue 
recognition, in terms of applicable accounting standards.
-
  
Testing the design, implementation and operating 

effectiveness of the Company™s general IT controls and Key 

IT/manual controls. These are in respect of the Company™s 

controls which govern timing of recognition of revenue 

including creation of new customers in system.
-
  
Tested, by selecting statistical samples, underlying 

documentation and records i.e. invoices, acknowledge 

delivered receipts and collection receipts for sales 

transactions recorded throughout the year and at year end 

to determine the existence of revenue.
-
  
Tested, by selecting statistical samples, the underlying 

documentation related to credit notes such as invoices and 

approval of sales return.
-
  
Performing cut - off procedures at year end by verifying 

underlying invoices, acknowledge delivered receipts, the 

transit time to deliver the goods and its revenue recognition.
-
 
Analysis of one-off sales made to customers.
-
  
Testing, by selecting statistical samples, of Daily Cash Report 
and checking the deposit of daily cash received in bank

Consolidated Auditors™ Report
Other Information
The Holding Company™s management and Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other 
information comprises the information included in the holding Company™s annual report, but does not include the 
consolidated financial statements and our auditors™ report thereon.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial 

statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the 

work we have performed and based on the work done/ audit report of other auditors, we conclude that there is a 

material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this 

regard.
Management™s and 
Board of Directors™
 Responsibilities for the Consolidated Financial Statements

The Holding Company™s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the preparation and presentation 
of these consolidated financial statements in term of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of 

the consolidated state of affairs, consolidated profit and other comprehensive income, consolidated statement of 

changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group including its joint venture in accordance with the 
accounting 

principles generally accepted in India, 
including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 
of the Act. The respective Management and Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its joint 

venture are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for 

safeguarding the assets of each company. and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; the selection 

and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 

and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively 

for ensuring accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the 

consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due 

to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the 

Management and Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Management and Board of Directors of the companies 
included in the Group and of its joint venture are responsible for assessing the ability of each company to continue 

as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 

accounting unless

 either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or 

has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its joint venture are responsible for 
overseeing the financial reporting process of each company.
Auditor™s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor™s report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 

resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 

omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company and such other entities included in 

the consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, 

the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in 

internal control that we identify during our audit.
  
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 

requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that 

may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
  
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were 

of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore 

the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors™ report unless law or regulation precludes public 

disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not 

be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to 

outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Other Matters
(a)
  
We did not audit the financial statements of four subsidiaries, whose financial statements reflect total assets 
(before consolidation adjustments) of Rs. 5,149.23 lakhs as at 31 March 2022, total revenues (before consolidation 
adjustments) of Rs. 8,304.61 lakhs and net cash flows (before consolidation adjustments) amounting to Rs.704.94 
lakhs for the year ended on that date, as considered in the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated 
financial statements also include the Group™s share of net profit (and other comprehensive income) of Rs.569.69 

for the year ended 31 March 2022, in respect of one joint venture, whose financial statements have not been 

audited by us. These financial statements have been audited by other auditors whose reports have been furnished 
to us by the Management and our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, in so far as it relates to the 
amounts and disclosures included in respect of these subsidiaries and joint venture and our report in terms of sub-
section (3) of Section 143 of the Act, in so far as it relates to the aforesaid subsidiaries and joint venture is based 

solely on the audit reports of the other auditors.
  
Certain of these subsidiaries
 
are located outside India whose financial statements and other financial information 
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in their respective countries 
and which have been audited by other auditors under generally accepted auditing standards applicable in 
their respective countries. The Holding Company™s management has converted the financial statements of such 

subsidiaries located outside India from accounting principles generally accepted in their respective countries 

to accounting principles generally accepted in India. We have audited these conversion adjustments made by 
the Company™s management. Our opinion in so far as it relates to the balances and affairs of such subsidiaries 
located outside India is based on the report of other auditors and the conversion adjustments prepared by the 
management of the Holding Company and audited by us.
  
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, and our report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements 

below, is not modified in respect of the above matters with respect to our reliance on the work done and the 

reports of the other auditors and the financial statements certified by the Management.

Opinion

In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended 
31 March 2022, we have audited the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements of 

Nilkamal Limited (hereinafter referred to as ﬁthe Holding Companyﬂ) and such companies incorporated in India under 

the Companies Act, 2013 which are its subsidiary companies and its joint venture companies as of that date.
In our opinion, the Holding Company and such companies incorporated in India which are its subsidiary companies and 
joint venture company, have, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 

financial statements and such internal financial controls were operating effectively as at 31 March 2022, based on the 

internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements criteria established by 
such companies
 
considering the essential components of such internal controls stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial 

Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the ﬁGuidance Noteﬂ).
Management™s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls

The respective Company™s management and the Board of Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining 
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements based on the criteria established by 

the respective Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note. These 

responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were 

operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective 

company™s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and 

completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under 

the Companies Act, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as ﬁthe Actﬂ).
Auditors™ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on 

Auditing, prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls 

with reference to consolidated financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements were established and maintained and if 
such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial 

controls with reference to consolidated financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial 

controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and 

testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of the internal controls based on the assessed risk. The 

procedures selected depend on the auditor™s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement 

of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors of the 
relevant subsidiary companies and joint venture company in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters 

paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls 

with reference to consolidated financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial controls with Reference to Consolidated Financial Statements

A company's internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements 

for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial 

controls with reference to consolidated financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain 

to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions 

of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 

preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 

expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors 

of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised 

acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Consolidated Auditors™ Report
127
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial controls with Reference to consolidated Financial 
Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, 
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to 

error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, 

or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Other Matters

Our aforesaid reports under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements insofar as it relates to one subsidiary company and 

one join venture company, which are companies incorporated in India, is based on the corresponding reports of the 

auditors of such companies incorporated in India.

The Group offsets tax assets and liabilities if and only if it has a legally enforceable right to set off current 
tax assets and current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income 

taxes levied by the same tax authority. 
 
2. 
 
Management judgement is required in determining provision for income tax, deferred income tax assets 
 
  
and liabilities and recoverability of deferred income tax assets. The recoverability of deferred income tax
 
  
assets is based on estimates of taxable income in which the relevant entity operates and the period over 
 
  
which deferred income tax assets will be recovered.

Significant accounting policies
a)
 
Basis of preparation of consolidated Financial Statements:
  
The Consolidated Financial Statements comprise the financial statements of Nilkamal Limited (ﬁthe holding 

Companyﬂ) and its subsidiaries (ﬁthe holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred as the Groupﬂ) and 

the group™s interest in joint ventures. Company have been prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting 

Standards (Ind AS) to comply with the section 133 of the Companies Act 2013 (ﬁthe Actﬂ), and read with Rule 3 of 

the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015 and Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2016. 

The financial statements were authorised for issue by the Holding Company™s Board of Directors on 23
rd
 May 2022.
  
All the assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non current as per the Group™s normal operating 
cycle and other criteria set out in Schedule III to the Act. Based on the nature of products and the time between 
the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalent, the Group has ascertained 
the operating cycle to be 12 months.
b)
 
Principles of Consolidation:
  
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Nilkamal Limited (ﬁthe Holding 

Companyﬂ), its subsidiaries (the Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred as ﬁthe Groupﬂ) and the 
group™s interest in joint ventures.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Subsidiaries
  
Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) that are controlled by the Company. Control exists 
when the Company is exposed to, or has the ability to affect those returns through power over the entity. In 

assessing control, potential voting rights are considered only if the rights are substantive. The financial statements 

of subsidiaries are included in these consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until 
the date that control ceases. The financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries have been consolidated 
using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances as mentioned in 

those policies.
  
Upon loss of control, the Group derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any non-controlling 

interests and the other components of equity related to the subsidiary. Any surplus or deficit arising on the loss 

of control is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. If the Company retains any interest in 

the previous subsidiary, then such interest is measured at fair value at the date that control is lost. Subsequently, 

it is accounted for as an equity accounted investee depending on the level of influence retained.
 
Joint ventures (equity accounted investees)
  
Joint arrangements are those arrangements over which the Company has joint control, established by contractual 
agreement and requiring unanimous consent for strategic financial and operating decisions. Investments in 
jointly controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method (equity accounted investees) and are initially 

recognised at cost. The carrying value of the Company™s investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, 

net of any accumulated impairment losses. The Company does not consolidate entities where the non-controlling 

interest (ﬁNCIﬂ) holders have certain significant participating rights that provide for effective involvement in 

significant decisions in the ordinary course of business of such entities. Investments in such entities are accounted 

by the equity method of accounting. When the Company™s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity 

accounted investee, the carrying amount of that interest (including any long-term investments) is reduced to zero 

and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Company has an obligation or 

has made payments on behalf of the investee.
 
Transactions eliminated on consolidation:
  
The financial statements of the subsidiaries and the joint ventures used for the purpose of consolidation are 

drawn upto the same reporting date as that of the Holding Company, i.e. 31

Use of 
E
stimates and Judgements:
  
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with Ind AS requires use of estimates 
and assumptions for some items, which might have an effect on their recognition and measurement in the 

consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of profit and loss. The actual amounts realised may differ 

from these estimates.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with Ind AS requires use of estimates and assumptions 

for some items, which might have an effect on their recognition and measurement in the balance sheet and 

statement of profit and loss. The actual amounts realised may differ from these estimates.
 
Estimates and assumptions are required in particular for:

Determination of the estimated useful lives of Property, plant and equipment
   
Useful lives of Property plant and equipment are based on the life prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies 

Act, 2013. In cases, where the useful lives are different
   
from that prescribed in Schedule II for plant and machinery and dies and moulds, they are based on 

technical advice, taking into account the nature of the asset, the estimated usage of the asset, the operating 
conditions of the asset, past history of replacement, anticipated technological changes, manufacturers™ 
warranties and maintenance support.

Recognition and measurement of de˜ned bene˜t obligations
   
The obligation arising from defined benefit plan is determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions. Key 
actuarial assumptions include discount rate, trends in salary escalation, actuarial rates and life expectancy. 

The discount rate is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on 

government bonds. The period to maturity of the underlying bonds correspond to the probable maturity 

of the post-employment benefit obligations.

Recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities
    
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for the future tax consequences of temporary differences 

between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and unutilised business 

loss and depreciation carry-forwards and tax credits. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent 

that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which the deductible temporary 

differences, unused tax losses, depreciation carry-forwards and unused tax credits could be utilised.

Recognition and measurement of other provisions
   
The recognition and measurement of other provisions are based on the assessment of the probability of 
an outflow of resources, and on past experience and circumstances known at the balance sheet date. 
The actual outflow of resources at a future date may therefore vary from the amount included in other 
provisions.
   
All financial assets / liabilities are required to be measured at fair value on initial recognition. In case of 

financial liabilities/assets which are required to subsequently be measured at amortised cost, interest is 

accrued using the effective interest method.

Segment reporting
   
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief 
Operating Decision Maker. The Group prepares its segment information in conformity with the accounting 
policies adopted for preparing and presenting the consolidated financial statements of the Group as a 
whole.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
151

Fair value of ˜nancial instruments
   
Derivatives are carried at fair value. Derivatives includes foreign currency forward contracts and interest 
rate swaps. Fair value of foreign currency forward contracts are determined using the fair value reports 

provided by respective bankers. Fair value of interest rate swaps are determined with respect to current 

market rate of interest.
  
Measurement of fair values
   
The Group™s accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values for financial 

instruments.
   
The Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. The 
management regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If third party 
information, such as broker quotes or pricing services, is used to measure fair values, then the management 
assesses the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion that such valuations meet 

the requirements of Ind AS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which such valuations should 

be classified.
   
When measuring the fair value of a financial asset or a financial liability, the Group uses observable market 

data as far as possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on 

the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows.
 
Level 1
 : quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
  
Level 2
 : inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
  
Level 3
 : inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable 
inputs).
  
If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the 

fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level 

of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.
  
The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting 

period during which the change has occurred.

Standards issued but not yet effective:
  
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (ﬁMCAﬂ) notifies new standard or amendments to the existing standards under 

Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. On March 23, 2022, MCA amended 

the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2022, applicable from April 1st, 2022, as below:

as part of applying the acquisition method, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed must 
meet the definitions of assets and liabilities in the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting under 

Indian Accounting Standards (Conceptual Framework) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 

India at the acquisition date. These changes do not significantly change the requirements of Ind AS 103.

company is preparing the asset for its intended use. Instead, an entity will recognise such sales proceeds 
and related cost in profit or loss.

e)
 
Property, plant and equipment:
 
i.
 
Recognition and measurement
   
Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any 
accumulated impairment losses.
  
The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises:
  
a)
  
Its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade 

discounts and rebates.
  
b)
  
Any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to 

be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
  
c)
  
The initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on 

which it is located, the obligation for which an entity incurs either when the item is acquired or as a 

consequence of having used the item during a particular period for purposes other than to produce 

inventories during that period.
    
Income and expenses related to the incidental operations, not necessary to bring the item to the 
location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by 
management, are recognised in consolidated profit or loss.
    
Items such as spare parts, stand-by equipments and servicing that meets the definition of property, 

plant and equipment are capitalised at cost and depreciated over the useful life If significant parts 

of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, then they are accounted 

and depreciated for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.
    
Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in profit or loss.
    
Capital work in progress is stated at cost and includes the cost of the assets that are not ready for 

their intended use at the Balance Sheet date.
  
Subsequent expenditure
   
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated 
with the expenditure will flow to the Group.

Intangible Fixed Assets
   
Intangible Fixed assets, which are acquired by the Group and have finite useful lives are measured at cost 
less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
   
All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognised in 

profit or loss as incurred.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
153
h)
 
Goodwill on Consolidation
  
Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is not amortised but it is tested for impairment annually or more 
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired, and is carried at cost 

less accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of 

goodwill relating to the entity sold.
i)
 
Amortisation
  
Software (Intangible assets) are amortised over their estimated useful lives on a straight-
 
line basis but not exceeding the period of 36 months.
  
Useful life of Intangible assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted prospectively, if 
appropriate
j)
 
Financial Instruments
  
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability 
or equity instrument of another entity. Financial instruments also include derivative contracts such as foreign 
currency foreign exchange forward contracts and, interest rate swaps and currency options; and embedded 
derivatives in the host contract.
  
Financial instruments also covers contracts to buy or sell a non-financial item that can be settled net in cash or 
another financial instrument, or by exchanging financial instruments, as if the contracts were financial instruments, 

with the exception of contracts that were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or 

delivery of a non-financial item in accordance with the entity™s expected purchase, sale or usage requirements.
  
Derivatives are currently recognised at fair value on the date on which the derivative contract is entered into and 

are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period.
 
Cash Flow Hedges
  
The Group uses derivative financial instrument such as forward contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps 

to hedge its foreign currency risks and interest rate risks. Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised 

at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair 

value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the 

fair value is negative.
  
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to the Statement of 
Profit and Loss, except for the effective portion of cash flow hedge, which is recognised in Other Comprehensive 
Income and accumulated in Cash Flow Hedge Reserve included in the Reserves and Surplus while any ineffective 
portion is recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
 
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as:
 
Fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability.
  
Cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to particular risk 

associated with a recognised asset or liability.
  
At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship 

to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for 

undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item 

or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the effectiveness of changes in 

the hedging instrument™s fair value in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item™s fair value or cash 

flows attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting 

changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have 

been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated.
  
Hedge accounting is discontinued from the last testing date when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 

terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Cumulative gain or loss on such hedging 

instrument recognised in Cash Flow Hedge Reserve is retained there until the forecasted transaction occurs. If a 

hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in Cash Flow Hedge 

Reserve is transferred to consolidated statement of Profit and Loss for the year.
 
Financial assets
 
Classi˜cation
  
The Group shall classify financial assets as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other 
comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss on the basis of its business model for managing the 
financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
154
 
Initial recognition and measurement
  
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value 
through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Purchases or 

sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention 

in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Group commits 
to purchase or sell the asset.
 
Debt instruments at amortised cost
 
A 
  
‚debt instrument™ is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:
  
a)
  
The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual 

cash flows, and
  
b)
  
Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of 

principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.
  
After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 

interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on 
acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in finance 
income in the profit or loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the profit or loss. This category 
generally applies to trade and other receivables. For more information on receivables, (Refer note 47).
 E
quity investments
  
All equity investments in scope of Ind-AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for 
trading are classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Group decides to classify the same either 

as at FVOCI or FVTPL. The Group makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The classification is 

made on initial recognition and is irrevocable.
  
If the Group decides to classify an equity instrument as FVOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, 

excluding dividends, are recognised in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to profit and loss, 

even on sale of investment. However, the Group may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.
  
Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in 

the profit and loss.
 
Derecognition
  
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a Group of similar financial assets) is 
primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from the Group™s balance sheet) when:

 
to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‚pass-through™ 
arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, 
or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, 
but has transferred control of the asset
   
When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a 

pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of 
ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the 
asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Group continues to recognise the transferred asset to 
the extent of the Group™s continuing involvement. In that case, the Group also recognises an associated 
liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights 
and obligations that the Group has retained.
   
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the 
lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the 
Group could be required to repay.
 
Impairment of ˜nancial assets
  
In accordance with Ind-AS 109, the Group applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and 

recognition of impairment loss on the following financial assets and credit risk exposure:
 
a)
  
Financial assets that are debt instruments, and are measured at amortised cost e.g., loans, debt securities, 

deposits, and bank balance.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
155
 
b)
  
Trade receivables - The application of simplified approach does not require the Group to track changes 
in credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting 

date, right from its initial recognition. Trade receivables are tested for impairment on a specific basis after 

considering the sanctioned credit limits, security like letters of credit, security deposit collected etc. and 

expectations about future cash flows.

  
Classi˜cation
   
The Group classifies all financial liabilities as subsequently measured at amortised cost, except for financial 
liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Such liabilities, including derivatives that are liabilities, shall be 

subsequently measured at fair value.
  
Initial recognition and measurement
   
Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or 
loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective 
hedge, as appropriate.
   
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and 
payables, net of directly attributable and incremental transaction cost.
   
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or 
costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement 
of profit and loss.
   
The Group™s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank 
overdrafts and derivative financial instruments.
  
Derecognition
   
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. 

When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different 

terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is 

treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in 

the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
  
Offsetting of ˜nancial instruments
   
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated 

balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is 

an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
k)
 
Valuation of Inventories:
  
Inventories of Raw Materials, Packing Materials, Stores and Spares, Work-in Progress, Traded goods and Finished 

goods are valued ‚at cost and net realisable value™ whichever is lower. Cost comprises all cost of purchase, 

appropriate direct production overheads and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present 

location and condition. Cost formulae used is ‚Weighted Average Cost™. Due allowance is estimated and made 

for defective and obsolete items, wherever necessary, based on the past experience of the Group. Net realisable 

value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and 

the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Raw materials and other supplies held for use in the production 

of inventories are not written down below cost except in case where material prices have declined and it is 

estimated that the cost of the finished product will exceed its net realisable value.
l)
 
Employee Benefits:
  
All employee benefits payable within twelve months of rendering the service are recognised in the period in 

which the employee renders the related service.
  
Contribution to Defined Contribution Plans such as Provident Fund, Employees™ State Insurance Corporation, etc., 

are charged to the consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as incurred.
valuation by an independent actuary at the end of each year, using the Projected Unit Credit Method. In the 
case of gratuity, which is funded, the fair value of the plan assets is reduced from the gross obligation under the 
defined benefit plans, to recognise the obligation on net basis.
  
Remeasurement of net defined benefit liability, which comprises actuarial gains and losses and the return on 

plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any excluding interest), are recognised 

immediately in other comprehensive income.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Other Long Term 
E
mployee Bene˜ts
 
Compensated Absences
  
Accumulated compensated absences, which are expected to be availed or encashed within 12 months from the 
end of the year end are treated as short term employee benefits. The obligation towards the same is measured 

at the expected cost of accumulating compensated absences as the additional amount expected to be paid as a 

result of the unused entitlement as at the year end. Accumulated compensated absences, which are expected to 
be availed or encashed beyond 12 months from the end of the year end are treated as other long term employee 
benefits. The Group™s liability is actuarially determined (using the Projected Unit Credit method) at the end of 

each year. Actuarial losses/ gains are recognised in the consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss in the year in 

which they arise.
m)
 
Foreign Exchange Transactions:
  
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies of the Group at the 

exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.
  
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency 

at the exchange rate at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value 

in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate when the fair value was 

determined. Foreign currency differences are generally recognised in profit or loss. Non-monetary items that are 

measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are not translated using the exchange rate at the date of 

the transactions.
  
Translation of ˜nancial statements of foreign entities
  
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into 
`
 (Indian Rupees) at the 
exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date and their statements of profit and loss are translated at exchange 

rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. For practical reasons, the group uses monthly closing rate to 

translate income and expense items, if the average rate approximates the exchange rates at the dates of the 

transactions. The exchange differences arising on translation for consolidation are recognised in Foreign Currency 
Translation Reserve. On disposal of a foreign operation, the component of Foreign Currency Translation Reserve 
relating to that particular foreign operation is reclassified to Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

Borrowing Costs:
  
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of an asset that necessarily takes 
a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset till 

the date it is ready for its intended use or sale.
 
Other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
o)
 
Revenue Recognition:
 
The Company derives revenues primarily from sale of manufactured goods, traded goods and related services.
  
Revenue is recognised on satisfaction of performance obligation upon transfer of control of promised products 

or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange 

for those products or services. The performance obligations in our contracts are fulfilled at the time of dispatch, 

delivery or upon formal customer acceptance depending on customer terms.
  
Revenue is measured based on transaction price which is fair value of the consideration received or receivable, 

after deduction of any discounts, sales incentives / schemes and any taxes or duties collected on behalf of the 

government such as goods and services tax, etc. Accumulated experience is used to estimate the provision for 
such discounts and sales incentives / schemes. Revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable 
a significant reversal will not occur.
 
Dividend income is recognised in statement of profit and loss only when the right to receive payment is established.
 
Export incentives receivable under various schemes are accounted on accrual basis.
 
Interest income is recognised using the effective interest rate method.
p)
 
Leases
  
At the inception it is assessed, whether a contract is a lease or contains a lease. A contract is a lease or contains 
a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, for a period of time, in exchange for 

consideration.
  
To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, Company assesses 

whether the contract involves the use of an identified asset. Use may be specified explicitly or implicitly.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
157




the period of use


when Company has the right to use the asset or Company designed the asset in a way that predetermines 
how and for what purpose it will be used.
   
At the commencement or modification of a contract, that contains a lease component, Company allocates 
the consideration in the contract, to each lease component, on the basis of its relative standalone prices. 
For leases of property, it is elected not to separate non-lease components and account for the lease and 
non-lease components as a single lease component.
 
As a Lessee:
 
Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date.
 
Right-of-use asset (ROU):
  
The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost. Cost comprises of the initial amount of the lease liability 

adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, any initial direct costs incurred by 
the lessee, an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset 
or the site on which it is located less any lease incentives received.
  
After the commencement date, a lessee shall measure the right-of-use asset applying cost model, which is cost 

less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses and also adjusted for certain re-
measurements of the lease liability.
  
Right-of-use asset is depreciated using straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease 
term. If the lease transfers the ownership of the underlying asset to the Company at the end of the lease term 

or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects Company will exercise the purchase option, ROU will be depreciated 

over the useful life of the underlying asset, which is determined based on the same basis as property, plant and 

equipment.
 
Lease liability:
  
Lease liability is initially measured at the present value of lease payments that are not paid at the commencement 

date. Discounting is done using the implicit interest rate in the lease, if that rate cannot be readily determined, 

then using Company™s incremental borrowing rate. Incremental borrowing rate is determined based on entity™s 

borrowing rate adjusted for terms of the lease and type of the asset leased.
  
Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprises of fixed payments (including in 

substance fixed payments), variable lease payments that depends on an index or a rate, initially measured using 

the index or rate at the commencement date, amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, 

the exercise price under a purchase option that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in 

an optional renewal period if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties 

for early termination of a lease unless the Company is reasonably certain not to terminate early.
  
Lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Lease liability is re-measured 

when there is a change in the lease term, a
 
change in its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, 
extension or termination option or a revised in-substance fixed lease payment, a
 
change in the amounts expected 
to be payable under a residual value guarantee and a change in future lease payments arising from change in an 

index or rate.
  
When the lease liability is re-measured corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-
of-use asset. If the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero it will be recorded in 
statement of profit and loss.
  
Right-of-use asset is presented under ﬁProperty Plant and Equipmentﬂ and lease liabilities are presented under 

ﬁFinancial liabilitiesﬂ in the balance sheet.
  
Company has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short term leases. The lease 

payments associated with these leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
158
 
Lessor
  
At the commencement or modification of a contract, that contains a lease component, Company allocates the 
consideration in the contract, to each lease component, on the basis of its relative standalone prices.
  
At the inception of the lease, it is determined whether it is a finance lease or an operating lease. If the lease 

transfers
 
substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset, then it is a 
financial lease, otherwise it is an operating lease.
  
If the lease arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, then the consideration in the contract is 

allocated using the principles of IND AS 115. The Company tests for the impairment losses at the year end. 
Payment received under operating lease is recognised as income on straight line basis, over the lease term.
  
The accounting policies applicable to the Company as a lessor, in the comparative period, were not different from 
IND AS 116.
q)
 
Business Combination:
  
The Group applies the acquisition method in accounting for business combinations. The consideration transferred 

by the Group to obtain control of a business is calculated as the sum of the fair values of assets transferred and 

liabilities assumed as at the acquisition date i.e. date on which it obtains control of the acquire, which includes 

the fair value of any asset or liability arising from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related 

costs are recognised in the statement of profit and loss as incurred, except to the extent related to the issue of 

debt or equity securities.
  
Where the consideration transferred exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the 

excess is recorded as goodwill. Alternatively, in case of bargain purchase wherein the consideration transferred 

is lower than the fair value of the net identifiable assets and liabilities assumed, the difference as a gain in other 

comprehensive income and accumulate the gain in equity as capital reserve
  
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair 

values on acquisition-date.
  
Intangible Assets acquired in a Business Combination and recognised separately from Goodwill are initially 
recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost).
  
Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a Business Combination are reported at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are 

acquired separately.
r)
 
Impairment of non-financial assets
  
Goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested 

annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be 

impaired.
  
The carrying values of assets/cash generating units at each balance sheet date are reviewed for impairment if any 

indication of impairment exists. If the carrying amount of the assets exceed the estimated recoverable amount, 

an impairment is recognised for such excess amount.
 
  
The recoverable amount is the greater of the net selling price and their value in use. Value in use is arrived at by 

discounting the future cash flows to their present value based on an appropriate discount factor.
  
When there is indication that an impairment loss recognised for an asset (other than a revalued asset) in 

earlier accounting periods which no longer exists or may have decreased, such reversal of impairment loss is 

recognised in the consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, to the extent the amount was previously charged 

to the consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. In case of revalued assets, such reversal is not recognised. An 

impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not subsequently reversed.
s)
 
Cash and cash equivalents
  
Cash and cash equivalent in the consolidated balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term 

deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in 
value.
  
For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-

term deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they are considered an integral part of 
the Group™s cash management.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
159
t)
 
Taxation
  
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. It is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that 
it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in OCI.
 
i.
 
Current tax
   
Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year 
and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. It is measured using tax 
rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Current tax also includes any tax arising from 

dividends.
  
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if, the Group:
  
a)
 
has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts; and
  
b)
 
intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
  
Uncertain Tax position:
   
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which 

applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. 

The provision is estimated based on one of two methods, the expected value method (the sum of the 

probability weighted amounts in a range of possible outcomes) or the single most likely amount method, 

depending on which is expected to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty.
 
ii.
 
Deferred tax
   
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 

liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not 

recognised for:
  
temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a 

business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;
  
temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and associates to the extent that the 
Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable 
that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
 
taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
   
Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary 
differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they 

can be used. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that 

it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised; such reductions are reversed when the 
probability of future taxable profits improves.
   
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognised to the extent that 
it has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used.
   
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when 

they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
   
The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in 

which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and 

liabilities.
  
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if:
  
a)
  
the entity has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities; and
  
b)
  
the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same 

taxation authority on the same taxable entity.
   
Deferred tax asset / liabilities in respect of on temporary differences which originate and reverse during the 

tax holiday period are not recognised. Deferred tax assets / liabilities in respect of temporary differences 

that originate during the tax holiday period but reverse after the tax holiday period are recognised.
u)
 
Government Grants:
  
Grants received from the government are recognised at their fair value where there is reasonable assurance that 

the grant will be received and the Group will comply with the conditions.
  
Government grants related to income are deferred and recognised in the profit or loss over the period necessary 

to match them with the costs that they are intended to compensate and netted off with the expense in the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
160
  
Government grants related to purchase of property plant and equipment are recognised by deducting the grant 
from the carrying amount of the property plant and equipment in which case the grant is recognised in profit or 

loss as a reduction of depreciation charged.
v)
 
Provisions, Contingent Assets and Contingent Liabilities:
  
A provision is recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past 
event and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation, in respect of which a reliable estimate can be made. These are reviewed at each balance sheet date 

and adjusted to reflect the current management estimates.
  
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future 

cash flows specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost.
  
Contingent Liabilities are disclosed in respect of possible obligations that arise from past events, but their existence 

is confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the 

control of the Company.
  
A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the 

occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity.
 

Contingent Assets are not recognised till the realisation of the income is virtually certain. However, the same are 

disclosed in the financial statements where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.
w)
 
Earnings per share
  
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit for the period attributable to the equity 

shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. 

The weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period and for all periods presented is 

adjusted for events, such as bonus shares, other than the conversion of potential equity shares that have changed 

the number of equity shares outstanding, without a corresponding change in resources.
  
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit for the period attributable to equity 
shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period is adjusted for the 
effects of all dilutive potential equity shares.

Financial risk management
 
The Group has exposure to the following risks arising from financial instruments:
 
 
Credit risk ;
 
 
 
Liquidity risk ; and
 
 
 
Market risk
i. 
 
Risk management framework
  
The Holding Company™s Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the 
Group's Risk Management Policy framework. The Board of Directors have adopted an Enterprise Risk Management 

Policy framed by the Group, which identifies the risk and lays down the risk minimisation procedures. The 

Movement reviews the Risk Management Policies and systems on a regular basis to reflect changes in market 

conditions and the Group's activities, and the same is reported to the Board of Directors periodically. Further, the 

Group, in order to deal with the future risks, has in place various methods / processes which have been imbibed 

in its organisational structure and proper internal controls are in place to keep a check on lapses, and the same 

are been modified in accordance with the regular requirements.
  
The audit committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group™s Risk Management 

Policies and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the Risk Management framework in relation to the risks 

faced by the Group. The audit committee is assisted in its oversight role by internal auditors.
ii.
 
Credit risk
  
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to 
meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the group's receivables from customers and loans and 
advances.
 
The carrying amount of following financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure:
 
Trade receivables and loans and advances.
  
The group™s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer in 
which it operates. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously 

monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the group grants credit terms in the normal course of 

business.
  
The Risk Management Committee has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analysed 

individually for creditworthiness before the group's standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are 

offered. Further for domestic sales, the group segments the customers into Distributors and Others for credit 

monitoring.
  
The group maintains security deposits for sales made to its distributor For other trade receivables, the company 

individually monitors the sanctioned credit limits as against the outstanding balances. Accordingly, the group 

makes specific provisions against such trade receivables wherever required and monitors the same at periodic 

intervals.
  
The group monitors each loans and advances given and makes any specific provision wherever required.
  
The group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of 

trade receivables and loans and advances.

iii.
 
Liquidity risk
  
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its 

financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group's approach to managing 

liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are 

due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the 

Group™s reputation.
  
As of 31 March, 2022 and 31 March, 2021 the Group had unutilized credit limits from banks of 
`

iv.
 
Market risk
attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including foreign currency receivables and payables 
and long term debt. We are exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk, interest rate 

risk and the market value of our investments. Thus, our exposure to market risk is a function of investing and 

borrowing activities and revenue generating and operating activities in foreign currency. The objective of market 

risk management is to avoid excessive exposure in our foreign currency revenues and costs.
 
Currency risk
  
The Group is exposed to currency risk on account of its borrowings and other payables in foreign currency. The 

functional currency of the Group is Indian Rupee (
`
). The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its 
currency risk, most with a maturity of less than one year from the reporting date.

Sensitivity analysis 
  
A reasonably possible strengthening (weakening) of the Foreign Currency against the Indian Rupee (
`
) at 31st 
March would have affected the measurement of financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies and 
affected equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in 
particular interest rates, remain constant and ignores any impact of forecast sales and purchases.

Interest rate risk: 
  
Interest rate risk can be either fair value interest rate risk or cash flow interest rate risk. Fair value interest rate 

risk is the risk of changes in fair values of fixed interest bearing investments because of fluctuations in the interest 

rates. Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of floating interest bearing investments will 

fluctuate because of fluctuations in the interest rates.
 E
xposure to interest rate risk
  
Group™s interest rate risk arises from borrowings. The interest rate profile of the Group™s interest-bearing financial 
instruments as reported to the management of the Group is as follows:

Fair value sensitivity analysis for ˜xed-rate instruments
  
The Group does not account for any fixed-rate financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or 
loss. Therefore, a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect profit or loss.
  
The Group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps. Under theses 

swaps, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange, the difference between fixed contract rates and floating 

rates interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional principal amounts
 
Cash ˚ow sensitivity analysis for variable-rate instruments
  
A reasonably possible change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased 

(decreased) profit or loss by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular 

foreign currency exchange rates, remain constant.

The risk estimates provided assume a parallel shift of 100 basis points interest rate across all yield curves. This 
calculation also assumes that the change occurs at the balance sheet date and has been calculated based on risk 

exposures outstanding as at that date. The period end balances are not necessarily representative of the average 

debt outstanding during the period.

Hedge accounting 
  
The Group™s risk management policy is to hedge its estimated foreign currency exposure in respect of highly 
probable forecast purchases and foreign currency borrowings. The Holding Company uses forward exchange 

contracts to hedge its currency risk and cross currency interest rate swap to hedge its interest rate and currency 

risk related to foreign currency borrowings. Such contracts are generally designated as cash flow hedges.
  
The Holding Company determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument 

and hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash flows. The Company assesses 

whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be and has been effective in 

offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method.
