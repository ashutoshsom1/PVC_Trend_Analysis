required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the 
state of affairs of the Company as at 31 March 2020, and profit and other comprehensive income, changes in equity 
and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.

Act. Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the ‚Auditor™s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements™ section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the

on the Standalone financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the 
standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters.
Description of Key Audit Matters
The key audit matter
How the matter was addressed in our audit
Revenue recognition
(Refer to Significant Accounting Policy Note 35(m) 
and Note 27 in the standalone financial statements)
Revenue of the Company mainly comprises of sale 
of material handling products and plastic moulded 
furniture to its customers.
Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when 
control is transferred to the customers.
There is a risk of revenue being overstated on 
account of variation in the timing of transfer of 
control due to the pressure to achieve performance 
targets at the reporting period end.
Accordingly, timing of recognition of revenue is a 
key audit matter.
In view of the significance of the matter we applied the 
following audit procedures in this area, among others to 
obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence
:
a.
Evaluating the Company™s accounting policies for 
revenue recognition, in terms of applicable accounting 
standards
b.
 
Testing the design, implementation and operating 
effectiveness of the Company™s general IT controls 
and key IT/manual application controls. These are in 
respect of 
 
the Company™s systems which govern timing 
of recognition of revenue including creation of new 
customers in the system.
c.
 
Performing testing on selected statistical samples of 
customer contracts. Checked terms and conditions 
related to acceptance of goods, acknowledged delivery 
receipts and tested the transit time to deliver the goods 
and its revenue recognition. Our tests of details focused 
on  
substantive testing. It included year-end cut-off 
testing. We carried out audit procedures by selecting 
samples of revenue transactions recorded during the 
year and before and after the financial year end. We 
also selected samples of one off sales to customers, 
by verifying the underlying documents such as sales 
invoices/contracts and shipping documents. 
d.
 
Performing substantive testing by verifying statistical 
samples of credit notes with underlying sales invoice 
and delivery documents.
e.
 
Assessing manual journal entries posted to revenue 
on sample basis to identify unusual items of revenue 
recorded in the current year.

The key audit matter
How the matter was addressed in our audit
Adoption of new lease accounting standard - Ind AS 
116
(Refer to Significant Accounting Policy Note 35(n) 
and Note 1 in the standalone financial statements)
The Company, as a lessee, has entered into lease 
contracts mainly relating to the depots, warehouses 
and retail stores of the Company with different 
contractual terms.
As described in note 35(n) to the standalone financial 
statements, the Company has adopted Ind AS 116, 
Leases (Ind AS 116) in the current year using modified 
retrospective approach. 
Ind AS 116 provides a single lease accounting model, 
requiring lessees to recognise a right of use asset (ﬁROU 
assetﬂ) and a corresponding lease liability on the lease 
commencement date. The Company has recognized 
the operating lease liabilities based on the present 
value of the remaining minimum rental payments 
discounted using the incremental borrowing rate, 
with corresponding ROU assets on the balance sheet. 
The Company uses automated report developed in 
SAP system to compute the Ind AS 116 liabilities.
We considered the first-time application of Ind AS 116 
as a key audit matter due to the judgements needed 
in establishing the underlying key assumptions.
In view of the significance of the matter we applied the 
following audit procedures in this area, among others to 
obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence:
a.
 
Evaluating the accounting policies regarding leases in 
terms of applicable accounting standard (Ind AS 116);
b.
 
Testing the manual and automated controls in respect 
of the lease accounting impact as computed under SAP 
system;
c.
 
Evaluating the method and adjustments of transition; 
d.
 
Testing completeness of the lease data used for lease 
accounting. We reconciled the Company™s operating 
lease commitments to data used in computing ROU 
asset and the lease liabilities.
e.
 
Selected a sample of lease contracts. We performed 
following procedures:
i.
 
evaluating the terms of the contract; 
ii.
 
evaluating the contract meeting the definition of a 
lease;
iii.
 
evaluating the Company™s assessment of identification 
of leases based on contractual agreements;
iv.
 
checking the Company™s determination of lease 
payments, based on the terms of the lease contract;
v.
 
evaluating the Company™s determination of the lease 
term, which required consideration of which option 
periods are certain to be exercised; and
vi.
 
Examining the Company™s judgement in establishing 
the underlying assumptions. This includes assessing 
the discount rate used in determining the lease 
liability;
f.
 
Assessing and testing the presentation and disclosures 
relating to Ind AS 116 including, disclosures relating to 
transition.
Information Other than the Standalone Financial Statements and Auditors™ Report Thereon
The Company™s management and Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information 
comprises the information included in the Company™s annual report, but does not include the financial statements and 
our auditors™ report thereon.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the 
work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required 
to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Management™s and Board of Directors™ Responsibility for the Standalone Financial Statements 
The Company™s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act 
with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs, profit and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with 
the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under 
section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with 
the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and 
other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate  internal  financial  controls 
that were operating effectively for ensuring accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the 
preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, the Management and Board of Directors are responsible for assessing 
the Company™s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using 
the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Company™s financial reporting process.

Independent Auditors™ Report
Auditor™s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Standalone
 
Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
standalone 
financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor™s report that includes 
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
standalone 
financial statements. 
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the 
standalone 
financial statements, whether due to 
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements 
in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures in the standalone financial statements made by the Management and Board of Directors.
Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of 
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events 
or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company™s ability to continue as a going concern. If we 
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor™s report to the related 
disclosures in the 
standalone 
financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor™s report. However, future 
events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the 
standalone 
financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the 
standalone 
financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in 
a manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing 
of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify 
during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit 
matters. We describe these matters in our auditors™ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about 
the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our 
report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication.

Management™s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The Company™s management and the Board of Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal 
financial controls based on the internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements criteria 
established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note. These 
responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company™s 
policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness 
of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies 
Act, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as ﬁthe Actﬂ).
Auditors™ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company™s internal financial controls with reference to standalone 
financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards 
on Auditing, prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls 
with reference to standalone financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with 
ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements were established and maintained and whether such 
controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
with reference to standalone financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls 
with reference to standalone financial statements included obtaining an understanding of such internal financial controls, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of 
internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor™s judgement, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion 
on the Company™s internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial controls with Reference to Standalone Financial Statements
A company™s internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of standalone financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company™s internal 
financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements include those policies and procedures that (1) pertain 
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions 
of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of standalone financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that 
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and 
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised 
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company™s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial controls with Reference to Standalone Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements, 
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error 
or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with 
reference to standalone financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls 
with reference to standalone financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the 
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group, and its joint venture 
as at 31 March 2020, of its consolidated profit and other comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity and 
consolidated cash flows for the year then ended.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the 
Act. Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the 
Auditor™s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements

accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in 
terms of the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the relevant provisions of the

on the consolidated financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters.
The key audit matter
How the matter was addressed in our audit
Revenue recognition
(Refer to Significant Accounting Policy Note 35 
(o) and Note 27 in the consolidated financial 
statements)
Revenue of the Company mainly comprises of sale 
of material handling products and plastic moulded 
furniture to its customers.
Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when 
control is transferred to the customers.
There is a risk of revenue being overstated on 
account of variation in the timing of transfer of 
control due to the pressure to achieve performance 
targets at the reporting period end.
Accordingly, timing of recognition of revenue is a 
key audit matter.
In view of the significance of the matter we applied the 
following audit procedures in this area, among others to obtain 
sufficient appropriate audit evidence
:
a.
 
Evaluating the Company™s accounting policies for 
revenue recognition, in terms of applicable accounting 
standards
b.
 
Testing the design, implementation and operating 
effectiveness of the Company™s general IT controls 
and key IT/manual application controls. These are in 
respect of the Company™s systems which govern timing 
of recognition of revenue including creation of new 
customers in the system.
c.
 
Performing testing on selected statistical samples of 
customer contracts. Checked terms and conditions related 
to acceptance of goods, acknowledged delivery receipts 
and tested the transit time to deliver the goods and 
its revenue recognition. Our tests of details focused on 
substantive testing. It included year-end cut-off testing. 
We carried out audit procedures by selecting samples 
of revenue transactions recorded during the year and 
before and after the financial year end. We also selected 
samples of one off sales to customers, by verifying the 
underlying documents such as sales invoices/contracts 
and shipping documents.
d.
 
Performing substantive testing by verifying statistical 
samples of credit notes with underlying sales invoice and 
delivery documents
e.

As described in note 35 (p) to the consolidated 
financial statements, the Company has adopted Ind 
AS 116, Leases (Ind AS 116) in the current year using

requiring lessees to recognise a right of use asset 
(ﬁROU assetﬂ) and a corresponding lease liability 
on the lease commencement date. The Company 
has recognized the operating lease liabilities based 
on the present value of the remaining minimum 
rental payments discounted using the incremental 
borrowing rate, with corresponding ROU assets on 
the balance sheet. The Company uses automated 
report developed in SAP system to compute the Ind 
AS 116 liabilities.

(q) and Note 43 in the consolidated financial 
statements)

50% of the shares of Nilkamal BITO Storage Systems

Storage Systems Private Limited) on 22 August 2019. 
The Group has accounted for this acquisition as a 
business combination as per Ind AS 103 with effect

Allocation (PPA) as of the acquisition date along 
with recognizing resultant Goodwill on acquisition.
The Company has involved external Valuation expert 
for determination of fair value for measurement of 
employee benefits provision, industrial land, facility 
buildings and other Property Plant and Equipment. 
Fair valuation measurement involves judgement 
towards use of key assumptions and the valuation 
methodology adopted and determination of 
discount rate.
Due to the complexity in accounting the business 
acquisition and the level of judgement included in 
fair value measurements, this is considered to be a 
key audit matter.

acquisition to understand the key terms and conditions 
of the acquisition.

Information Other than the Consolidated Financial Statements and Auditors™ Report Thereon
The Holding Company™s management and Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other 
information comprises the information included in the Holding Company™s annual report, but does not include the 
consolidated financial statements and our auditors™ report thereon.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the 
work we have performed and based on the work done/ audit reports of other auditors, we conclude that there is a 
material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this 
regard.
Management™s and 
Board of Directors™
 Responsibilities for the Consolidated Financial Statements
The Holding Company™s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the preparation and presentation 
of these consolidated financial statements in term of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of 
the consolidated state of affairs, consolidated profit and other comprehensive income, consolidated statement of 
changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group including its joint venture in accordance with the 
accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, 
including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 
of the Act. The respective Management and Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and its joint 
venture are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for 
safeguarding the assets of each company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; the selection 
and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively 
for ensuring accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the 
consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the 
Management and Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Management and Board of Directors of the companies 
included in the Group and its joint venture are responsible for assessing the ability of each company to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless 
the respective Board of Directors
 either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or 
has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and its joint venture is responsible for overseeing 
the financial reporting process of each company.
Auditor™s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor™s report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to 
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to the consolidated financial statements and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls based on our audit.
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by the Management and Board of Directors.
Conclude on the appropriateness of Management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting 
in preparation of consolidated financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the appropriateness of this 
assumption. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor™s 
report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, 
to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor™s 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and its 
joint venture
 to cease to continue as a 
going concern.
Consolidated Auditor™s Report
134
Auditor™s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Continued)
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in 
a manner that achieves fair presentation.
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of such entities or business 
activities within the Group and its 
joint venture
 to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We 
are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of financial information of such entities 
included in the consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent auditors. For the other entities 
included in the consolidated financial statements, which have been audited by other auditors, such other auditors 
remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain 
solely responsible for our audit opinion. Our responsibilities in this regard are further described in para (a) of the 
section titled ‚Other Matters™ in this audit report.
We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us along with the consideration of audit reports of the other auditors 
referred to in sub-paragraph (a) of the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company and such other entities included in 
the consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal 
control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit 
matters. We describe these matters in our auditors™ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about 
the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our 
report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication.
Other Matters
(a) We did not audit the financial statements of four subsidiaries whose financial statements reflect total assets of 
Rs.5,166.28 lakhs as at 31 March 2020, total revenues of Rs.6,642.62 lakhs and net cash flows amounting to

outside India from accounting principles generally accepted in their respective countries to accounting principles 
generally accepted in India. We have audited these conversion adjustments made by the Holding Company™s 
management. Our opinion in so far as it relates to the balances and affairs of such subsidiaries located outside 
India is based on the report of other auditors and the conversion adjustments prepared by the management of the 
Holding Company and audited by us.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, and our report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements

Annexure A to the Independent Auditors™ report on the consolidated financial statements of Nilkamal Limited for the 
year ended 31 March 2020 
Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the aforesaid consolidated financial statements under 
Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013
(Referred to in paragraph ((A)(f)) under ‚Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements™ section of our report 
of even date)
Opinion
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended 
31 March 2020, we have audited the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements of 
Nilkamal Limited (hereinafter referred to as ﬁthe Holding Companyﬂ) and such companies incorporated in India under 
the Companies Act, 2013 (‚the Actﬂ) which are its subsidiary companies and its joint venture companies, as of that date. 
In our opinion, the Holding Company and such companies incorporated in India which are its subsidiary companies and 
joint venture companies (jointly controlled companies), have, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements and such internal financial controls were operating effectively as 
at 31 March 2020, based on the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements criteria 
established by such companies considering the essential components of such internal controls stated in the Guidance Note 
on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India 
(the ﬁGuidance Noteﬂ).
Management™s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The Company™s management and the Board of Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal 
financial controls based on the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements criteria 
established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note. These 
responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective 
company™s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under 
the Act.
Auditors™ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company™s internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards 
on Auditing, prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with 
ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements were established and maintained and whether such 
controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing 
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of the internal controls based on the assessed risk. The procedures 
selected depend on the auditor™s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the 
consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors of the relevant subsidiary companies and joint venture company 
(jointly controlled companies) in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial controls with Reference to Consolidated Financial Statements 
A company™s internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company™s internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the 
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of 
the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and 
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition 
of the company™s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial controls with Reference to consolidated Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, 
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or 
fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference 
to consolidated financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with

reference to consolidated financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the 
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Other Matters
 
Our aforesaid reports under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements insofar as it relates to one subsidiary company and 
one  joint venture company, which are companies incorporated in India, is based on the corresponding reports of the

* In accordance with Ind As 116 prepaid lease rental is regrouped from Other Non current asset to Right of Use 
asset amounting to 
`
 350.04 Lakhs
   Notes :-
a)    The Group has adopted Ind AS 116 effective 1st April, 2019, using the modified retrospective method. The Group 
has applied the standard to its leases with the cumulative impact recognised on the date of initial application 
(1st April, 2019). Accordingly, previous period information has not been restated.
       This has resulted in recognising a right-of-use asset of 
`
 14,940.15 lakhs and a corresponding lease liability of 
` 
16,607.01 lakhs. The difference of 
`
 872.87 lakhs (net of deferred tax asset created of 
`
 469.89 lakhs and 
opening rent equalisation liability of 
`
 324.10 lakhs) has been adjusted to retained earnings as at 1st April 2019.
         In the statement of profit and loss for the current year, operating lease expenses which were recognised as other 
expenses in previous periods is now recognised as depreciation expense for the right-of-use asset and finance 
cost for interest accrued on lease liability. The adoption of this standard did not have any significant impact on 
the profit for the year and earnings per share. The weighted average incremental borrowing rate of 8.5% has 
been applied to lease liabilities recognised in the balance sheet at the date of initial application.
b)    The Group incurred 
`
 1,406.71 lakhs for the year ended 31st March, 2020 towards expenses relating to short-
term leases and leases of low-value assets. The total cash outflow for leases is 
`
 5,563.83 lakhs for the year ended 
31st March, 2020, including cash outflow of short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. Interest on lease 
liabilities is 
`
 1,360.34 lakhs for the year.
c)   The Group™s leases mainly comprise of land and buildings, Plant and equipment and Computer Server. The Group 
leases land and buildings for manufacturing and warehouse facilities. 
d)     Maturity analysis Undiscounted Contractual Future lease Outflow are as follows.

1.   The Group offsets tax assets and liabilities if and only if it has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax 
assets and current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes 
levied by the same tax authority.
2.   Management judgment is required in determining provision for income tax, deferred income tax assets and 
liabilities and recoverability of deferred income tax assets. The recoverability of deferred income tax assets 
is based on estimates of taxable income in which the relevant entity operates and the period over which 
deferred income tax assets will be recovered.
3.   The Group have elected to exercise the option permitted under Section 115BAA of the Income Tax Act, 1961 
as introduced by the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Ordinance, 2019. Accordingly, the Group have recognised 
provision for income tax for the year ended 31st March 2020 and re-measured its deferred tax balances basis 
the rate prescribed in the said Section. The full impact of this change has been recognised in the statement of 
profit and loss account for the year ended 31st March 2020.
     The group has reviewed its income tax treatments in order to determine whether Appendix C of Ind AS 12 
effective from April 1, 2019 could have an impact on the financial statements and concluded that it has no 
material impact on the Group™s financial statements

Significant accounting policies
a)
 
Basis of preparation of consolidated Financial Statements:
The Consolidated Financial Statements comprise the financial statements of Nilkamal Limited (ﬁthe holding 
Companyﬂ) and its subsidiaries (ﬁthe holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred as the Groupﬂ) and 
the group™s interest in joint ventures. Company have been prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting 
Standards (Ind AS) to comply with the section 133 of the Companies Act 2013 (ﬁthe Actﬂ), and read with Rule 
3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015 and Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules 2016. The financial statements were authorised for issue by the Holding Company™s Board of Directors 
on 28
th
 June 2020.
All the assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non current as per the Group™s normal operating 
cycle and other criteria set out in Schedule III to the Act. Based on the nature of products and the time 
between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realization in cash and cash equivalent, the Group 
has ascertained the operating cycle to be 12 months.
b)
 
Principles of Consolidation:
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Nilkamal Limited (ﬁthe Holding 
Companyﬂ), its subsidiaries (the Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred as ﬁthe Groupﬂ) and 
the group™s interest in joint ventures.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) that are controlled by the Company. Control 
exists when the Company is exposed to, or has the ability to affect those returns through power over the 
entity. In assessing control, potential voting rights are considered only if the rights are substantive. The financial 
statements of subsidiaries are included in these consolidated financial statements from the date that control 
commences until the date that control ceases. The financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries 
have been consolidated using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar 
circumstances as mentioned in those policies.
Upon loss of control, the Group derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any non-controlling 
interests and the other components of equity related to the subsidiary. Any surplus or deficit arising on the loss 
of control is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. If the Company retains any interest in 
the previous subsidiary, then such interest is measured at fair value at the date that control is lost. Subsequently, 
it is accounted for as an equity accounted investee depending on the level of influence retained.
Joint ventures (equity accounted investees)
Joint arrangements are those arrangements over which the Company has joint control, established by contractual 
agreement and requiring unanimous consent for strategic financial and operating decisions. Investments in 
jointly controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method (equity accounted investees) and are 
initially recognized at cost. The carrying value of the Company™s investment includes goodwill identified on 
acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The Company does not consolidate entities where the 
non-controlling interest (ﬁNCIﬂ) holders have certain significant participating rights that provide for effective 
involvement in significant decisions in the ordinary course of business of such entities. Investments in such 
entities are accounted by the equity method of accounting. When the Company™s share of losses exceeds 
its interest in an equity accounted investee, the carrying amount of that interest (including any long-term 
investments) is reduced to zero and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that 
the Company has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation:
Intra-Group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from intra-Group 
transactions, are eliminated in full while preparing these consolidated financial statements. Unrealized gains or 
losses arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the 
extent of the Company™s interest in the investee.
The financial statements of the subsidiaries and the joint ventures used for the purpose of consolidation are 
drawn upto the same reporting date as that of the Holding Company, i.e. 31 March 2020.

Functional and presentation currency
These consolidated financial statements are presented in Indian rupees in lakhs, which is the Holding 
Company™s functional currency. All amounts have been rounded off to two decimal places to the nearest lakh, 
unless otherwise indicated.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using uniform accounting policies for like 
transactions and other events in similar circumstances.
Historical cost convention
The Consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following:
certain consolidated financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instrument) that are measured 
at fair value;
defined benefit plans Œ plan assets measured at fair value
c)
 
Use of Estimates and Judgements:
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with Ind AS requires use of estimates 
and assumptions for some items, which might have an effect on their recognition and measurement in the 
consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of profit and loss. The actual amounts realised may 
differ from these estimates.
Estimates and assumptions are required in particular for:
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with Ind AS requires use of estimates and 
assumptions for some items, which might have an effect on their recognition and measurement in 
the balance sheet and statement of profit and loss. The actual amounts realised may differ from these 
estimates.
Estimates and assumptions are required in particular for:
Determination of the estimated useful lives of Property, plant and equipment
Useful lives of Property plant and equipment are based on the life prescribed in Schedule II of the 
Companies Act, 2013. In cases, where the useful lives are different from that prescribed in Schedule II 
156
for plant and machinery and dies and moulds, they are based on technical advice, taking into account the 
nature of the asset, the estimated usage of the asset, the operating conditions of the asset, past history 
of replacement, anticipated technological changes, manufacturers™ warranties and maintenance support.
Recognition and measurement of defined benefit obligations
The obligation arising from defined benefit plan is determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions. Key 
actuarial assumptions include discount rate, trends in salary escalation, actuarial rates and life expectancy. 
The discount rate is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on 
government bonds. The period to maturity of the underlying bonds correspond to the probable maturity 
of the post-employment benefit obligations.
Recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences 
between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and unutilized business 
loss and depreciation carry-forwards and tax credits. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent 
that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which the deductible temporary 
differences, unused tax losses, depreciation carry-forwards and unused tax credits could be utilized.
Recognition and measurement of other provisions
The recognition and measurement of other provisions are based on the assessment of the probability of 
an outflow of resources, and on past experience and circumstances known at the balance sheet date. 
The actual outflow of resources at a future date may therefore vary from the amount included in other 
provisions.
Discounting of long-term financial assets / liabilities
All financial assets / liabilities are required to be measured at fair value on initial recognition. In case of 
financial liabilities/assets which are required to subsequently be measured at amortised cost, interest is 
accrued using the effective interest method. 
Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief 
Operating Decision Maker. The Group prepares its segment information in conformity with the accounting 
policies adopted for preparing and presenting the consolidated financial statements of the Group as a 
whole.
Fair value of financial instruments
Derivatives are carried at fair value. Derivatives includes foreign currency forward contracts and interest 
rate swaps. Fair value of foreign currency forward contracts are determined using the fair value reports 
provided by respective merchant bankers. Fair value of interest rate swaps are determined with respect to 
current market rate of interest.
Measurement of fair values
The Group™s accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values for financial instruments.
The Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. The management 
regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If third party information, such as 
broker quotes or pricing services, is used to measure fair values, then the management assesses the evidence 
obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion that such valuations meet the requirements of Ind AS, 
including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which such valuations should be classified.
When measuring the fair value of a financial asset or a financial liability, the Group uses observable market data 
as far as possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs 
used in the valuation techniques as follows.
Level 1:
 
quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2:
 inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, 
either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
Level 3:
 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable 
inputs).
If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value 
157
hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value 
hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.
The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period 
during which the change has occurred.
(d)
 
Standards issued but not yet effective
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (ﬁMCAﬂ) notifies new standards or amendments to the existing standards. 
There is no such notification which would have been applicable from April 1, 2020.
e)
 
Property, plant and equipment:
i.
 
Recognition and measurement
Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any 
accumulated impairment losses.
The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises:
a)
 
Its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting 
trade discounts and rebates.
b)
 
Any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to 
be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
c)
 
The initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on 
which it is located, the obligation for which an entity incurs either when the item is acquired or as a 
consequence of having used the item during a particular period for purposes other than to produce 
inventories during that period.
Income and expenses related to the incidental operations, not necessary to bring the item to the location 
and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, are 
recognised in consolidated profit or loss.
Items such as spare parts, stand-by equipments and servicing that meets the definition of property, plant 
and equipment are capitalised at cost and depreciated over the useful life
If significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, then they are 
accounted and depreciated for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.
Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in profit or loss.
Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated 
with the expenditure will flow to the Group.
f)
 
Depreciation
Depreciation on Property, plant and equipment is provided on the straight-line method over the useful 
lives of assets as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 except for plant and 
machinery and Dies and moulds which is based on technical evaluation. Management believes that these 
useful lives best represent the period over which management expects to use these assets. Hence the useful 
life for plant and machinery of 10 years and for Dies and Moulds of 6 years for continuous running is 
different from the useful life as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013;
Useful life of property plant and equipment are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted 
prospectively, if appropriate
Cost of leasehold land is amortised over the period of lease;
Depreciation on addition to assets or on sale /discardment of assets, is calculated pro rata from the date of 
such addition or upto the date of such sale/discardment, as the case may be;
Assets like mobile phones, telephone instruments, etc. are fully depreciated in the year of purchase / 
acquisition;
Individual assets except assets given on lease acquired for less than 
`
 15,000/ Œ are depreciated entirely in 
the year of acquisition.
g)
 
Intangible Fixed Assets
Intangible Fixed assets, which are acquired by the Group and have finite useful lives are measured at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
158
All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognised in 
profit or loss as incurred.
h
Goodwill on Consolidation
Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is not amortised but it is tested for impairment annually or more 
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired, and is carried at cost 
less accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount 
of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
i)
 
Amortisation
Software (Intangible assets) are amortised over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis but not 
exceeding the period of 36 months.
Useful life of Intangible assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate
j)
 
Financial Instruments
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability 
or equity instrument of another entity. Financial instruments also include derivative contracts such as foreign 
currency foreign exchange forward contracts and, interest rate swaps and currency options; and embedded 
derivatives in the host contract.
Financial instruments also covers contracts to buy or sell a non-financial item that can be settled net in cash 
or another financial instrument, or by exchanging financial instruments, as if the contracts were financial 
instruments, with the exception of contracts that were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of 
the receipt or delivery of a non-financial item in accordance with the entity™s expected purchase, sale or usage 
requirements.
Derivatives are currently recognized at fair value on the date on which the derivative contract is entered into 
and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period.
Cash Flow Hedges
The Group uses derivative financial instrument such as forward contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps 
to hedge its foreign currency risks and interest rate risks. Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised 
at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair 
value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when 
the fair value is negative.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to the Statement of 
Profit and Loss, except for the effective portion of cash flow hedge, which is recognised in Other Comprehensive 
Income and accumulated in Cash Flow Hedge Reserve included in the Reserves and Surplus while any ineffective 
portion is recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as:
Fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability.
Cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to particular risk 
associated with a recognised asset or liability.
At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship 
to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for 
undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item 
or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the effectiveness of changes in 
the hedging instrument™s fair value in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item™s fair value or cash 
flows attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting 
changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have 
been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated.
Hedge accounting is discontinued from the last testing date when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Cumulative gain or loss on such hedging 
instrument recognised in Cash Flow Hedge Reserve is retained there until the forecasted transaction occurs. If 
a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in Cash Flow 
Hedge Reserve is transferred to consolidated statement of Profit and Loss for the year.
Financial assets
Classification
The Group shall classify financial assets as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other 
159
comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss on the basis of its business model for managing the 
financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.
Initial recognition and measurement
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair 
value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. 
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation 
or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the 
Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Debt instruments at amortised cost
A ‚debt instrument™ is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:
a)
 
The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual 
cash flows, and
b)
 
Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.
After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount 
or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation 
is included in finance income in the profit or loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in 
the profit or loss. This category generally applies to trade and other receivables. For more information 
on receivables, refer to Note 46.
Equity investments
All equity investments in scope of Ind-AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for 
trading are classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Group decides to classify the same either 
as at FVOCI or FVTPL. The Group makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The classification is 
made on initial recognition and is irrevocable.
If the Group decides to classify an equity instrument as FVOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, 
excluding dividends, are recognized in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to profit and 
loss, even on sale of investment. However, the Group may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.
Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized 
in the profit and loss.
Derecognition
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a Group of similar financial assets) 
is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from the Group™s balance sheet) when:
The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or
The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation 
to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‚pass-through™ 
arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, 
or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, 
but has transferred control of the asset
When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through 
arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has 
neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control 
of the asset, the Group continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the Group™s continuing 
involvement. In that case, the Group also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the 
associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained.
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower 
of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could 
be required to repay.
Impairment of financial assets
In accordance with Ind-AS 109, the Group applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and 
recognition of impairment loss on the following financial assets and credit risk exposure:
160
a)
 
Financial assets that are debt instruments, and are measured at amortised cost e.g., loans, debt securities, 
deposits, and bank balance.
b)
 
Trade receivables Œ The application of simplified approach does not require the Group to track changes 
in credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting 
date, right from its initial recognition. Trade receivables are tested for impairment on a specific basis after 
considering the sanctioned credit limits, security like letters of credit, security deposit collected etc. and 
expectations about future cash flows.
Financial liabilities
Classification
The Group classifies all financial liabilities as subsequently measured at amortised cost, except for financial 
liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Such liabilities, including derivatives that are liabilities, shall be 
subsequently measured at fair value.
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, 
loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as 
appropriate.
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, 
net of directly attributable and incremental transaction cost.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs 
that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of profit 
and loss.
The Group™s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts 
and derivative financial instruments.
Derecognition
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. 
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, 
or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as 
the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective 
carrying amounts is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
Offsetting of financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated balance 
sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to 
settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

Valuation of Inventories:
Inventories of Raw Materials, Packing Materials, Stores and Spares, Work-in Progress, Traded goods and Finished 
goods are valued ‚at cost and net realisable value™ whichever is lower. Cost comprises all cost of purchase, 
appropriate direct production overheads and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present 
location and condition. Cost formulae used is ‚Weighted Average Cost™. Due allowance is estimated and made 
for defective and obsolete items, wherever necessary, based on the past experience of the Group. Net realisable 
value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and 
the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Raw materials and other supplies held for use in the production 
of inventories are not written down below cost except in case where material prices have declined and it is 
estimated that the cost of the finished product will exceed its net realisable value.
l)
 
Employee Benefits:
All employee benefits payable within twelve months of rendering the service are recognised in the period in 
which the employee renders the related service.
Contribution to Defined Contribution Plans such as Provident Fund, Employees™ State Insurance Corporation, 
etc., are charged to the consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as incurred.
Defined Benefit Plans Œ The present value of the obligation under such plans, is determined based on an 
actuarial valuation by an independent actuary at the end of each year, using the Projected Unit Credit Method. 
In the case of gratuity, which is funded, the fair value of the plan assets is reduced from the gross obligation 
under the defined benefit plans, to recognise the obligation on net basis.
161
Remeasurement of net defined benefit liability, which comprises actuarial gains and losses and the return on 
plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any excluding interest), are recognized 
immediately in other comprehensive income.
Other Long Term Employee Benefits
Compensated Absences
Accumulated compensated absences, which are expected to be availed or encashed within 12 months from 
the end of the year end are treated as short term employee benefits. The obligation towards the same is 
measured at the expected cost of accumulating compensated absences as the additional amount expected to 
be paid as a result of the unused entitlement as at the year end. Accumulated compensated absences, which 
are expected to be availed or encashed beyond 12 months from the end of the year end are treated as other 
long term employee benefits. The Group™s liability is actuarially determined (using the Projected Unit Credit 
method) at the end of each year. Actuarial losses/ gains are recognised in the consolidated Statement of Profit 
and Loss in the year in which they arise.
m)
 
Foreign Exchange Transactions:
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies of the Group at the 
exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency 
at the exchange rate at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value 
in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate when the fair value was 
determined. Foreign currency differences are generally recognised in profit or loss. Non-monetary items that 
are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are not translated using the exchange rate at the 
date of the transactions.
Translation of financial statements of foreign entities

the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date and their statements of profit and loss are translated at 
exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. For practical reasons, the group uses an average 
rate to translate income and expense items, if the average rate approximates the exchange rates at the 
dates of the transactions. The exchange differences arising on translation for consolidation are recognised in 
Foreign Currency Translation Reserve. On disposal of a foreign operation, the component of Foreign Currency 
Translation Reserve relating to that particular foreign operation is reclassified to Consolidated Statement of 
Profit and Loss.
n)
 
Borrowing Costs:
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of an asset that necessarily 
takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use are capitalised as part of the cost of that 
asset till the date it is ready for its intended use or sale. Other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense 
in the period in which they are incurred.
o)
 
Revenue Recognition:
The Company derives revenues primarily from sale of manufactured goods, traded goods and related services.
Revenue is recognised on satisfaction of performance obligation upon transfer of control of promised products 
or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in 
exchange for those products or services. The performance obligations in our contracts are fulfilled at the time 
of dispatch, delivery or upon formal customer acceptance depending on customer terms.
Revenue is measured based on transaction price which is fair value of the consideration received or receivable, 
after deduction of any discounts, sales incentives / schemes and any taxes or duties collected on behalf of the 
government such as goods and services tax, etc. Accumulated experience is used to estimate the provision 
for such discounts and sales incentives / schemes. Revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly 
probable a significant reversal will not occur.
The Company recognises provision for sales return, based on the historical results, measured on net basis of 
the margin of the sale. An estimate is made of goods that will be returned and a liability is recognised for this 
amount using a best estimate based on accumulated experience.
Dividend income is recognized in statement of profit and loss only when the right to receive payment is 
established.
Export incentives receivable under various schemes are accounted on accrual basis.
Interest income is recognized using the effective interest rate method.

Leases
Effective 1 April, 2019, Company adopted IND AS 116 Œ Leases. Company applied IND AS 116 using modified 
retrospective approach, under which the cumulative effect of initial application is recognized in retained 
earnings at 1st April 2019. The comparative information presented is not restated. It is presented as previously 
reported under IND AS 17.
Accounting policy applicable before 1st April 2019
The determination of whether an arrangement is (or contains) a lease is based on the substance of the 
arrangement at the inception of the lease. The arrangement is, or contains a lease if fulfillment of the 
arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and the arrangement conveys a right to use 
the asset or assets, even if that right is not explicitly specified in the arrangement.
As a lessee
Leases of assets where Company has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance 
leases. Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance charge and 
the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term 
so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
The leased assets are measured initially at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value 
of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the assets are accounted for in accordance 
with the accounting policy applicable to that asset.
Leases of assets under which significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor 
are classified as operating leases. Lease payments under operating leases are recognised as an expense
 
on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term unless the payments are structured to increase in line with expected 
general inflation to compensate for the lessor™s expected inflationary cost increases. Lease incentives received 
are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense, over the term of the lease.
As lessor
Leases in which Company does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset are 
classified as operating leases. Rental income from operating lease is recognized on a straight line basis over 
the term of the relevant lease unless such payments are structured to increase in line with expected general 
inflation to compensate for the lessor™s expected inflationary cost increase.
Accounting policy applicable from 1
st
 
April 2019
At the inception it is assessed, whether a contract is a lease or contains a lease. A contract is a lease or contains 
a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, for a period of time, in exchange for 
consideration.
To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, Company assesses 
whether the contract involves the use of an identified asset. Use may be specified explicitly or implicitly.
Use should be physically distinct or represent substantially all of the capacity of a physically
 
distinct 
asset.
If the supplier has a substantive substitution right, then the asset is not identified.
Company has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset 
throughout the period of use
Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.
In cases where the usage of the asset is predetermined the right to direct the use of the asset is 
determined when Company has the right to use the asset or Company designed the asset in a way 
that predetermines how and for what purpose it will be used.
At the commencement or modification of a contract, that contains a lease component, Company allocates 
the consideration in the contract, to each lease component, on the basis of its relative standalone prices. For 
leases of property, it is elected not to separate non-lease components and account for the lease and non-lease 
components as a single lease component.
As a Lessee:
Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date.
163
Right-of-use asset (ROU):
The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost. Cost comprises of the initial amount of the lease liability 
adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, any initial direct costs incurred by 
the lessee, an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset 
or the site on which it is located less any lease incentives received.
After the commencement date, a lessee shall measure the right-of-use asset applying cost model, which is Cost 
less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses and also adjusted for certain re-
measurements of the lease liability.
Right-of-use asset is depreciated using straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease 
term. If the lease transfers the ownership of the underlying asset to the Company at the end of the lease term 
or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects Company will exercise the purchase option, ROU will be depreciated 
over the useful life of the underlying asset, which is determined based on the same basis as property, plant and 
equipment.
Lease liability:
Lease liability is initially measured at the present value of lease payments that are not paid at the commencement 
date. Discounting is done using the implicit interest rate in the lease, if that rate cannot be readily determined, 
then using Company™s incremental borrowing rate. Incremental borrowing rate is determined based on entity™s 
borrowing rate adjusted for terms of the lease and type of the asset leased.
Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprises of fixed payments (including in 
substance fixed payments), variable lease payments that depends on an index or a rate, initially measured using 
the index or rate at the commencement date, amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, 
the exercise price under a purchase option that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in 
an optional renewal period if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties 
for early termination of a lease unless the Company is reasonably certain not to terminate early.
Lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Lease liability is re-measured 
when there is a change in the lease term, a
 
change in its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, 
extension or termination option or a revised in-substance fixed lease payment, a
 
change in the amounts expected 
to be payable under a residual value guarantee and a change in future lease payments arising from change in 
an index or rate.
When the lease liability is re-measured corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-
of-use asset. If the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero it will be recorded in 
statement of profit and loss.
Right-of-use asset is presented under ﬁProperty Plant and Equipmentﬂ and lease liabilities are presented under 
ﬁFinancial liabilitiesﬂ in the balance sheet.
Company has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short term leases. The lease 
payments associated with these leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Lessor
At the commencement or modification of a contract, that contains a lease component, Company allocates the 
consideration in the contract, to each lease component, on the basis of its relative standalone prices.
At the inception of the lease, it is determined whether it is a finance lease or an operating lease. If the lease 
transfers
 
substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset, then it is a 
financial lease, otherwise it is an operating lease.
If the lease arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, then the consideration in the contract is 
allocated using the principles of IND AS 115. The Company tests for the impairment losses at the year end. 
Payment received under operating lease is recognised as income on straight line basis, over the lease term.
The accounting policies applicable to the Company as a lessor, in the comparative period, were not different 
from IND AS 116.
Transitional impact:
On transition to IND AS 116, Company elected to apply practical expedients given by the standard as follows:
(a) Company has not re-assessed whether a contract is, or contains, a lease at the date of initial application 
instead it applied the standard to those contracts that were previously identified as leases applying IND AS 
17, Leases. Standard is not applied to those contracts that were not previously identified as containing a lease 
applying IND AS 17.
164
(b) IND AS 116 is applied retrospectively, with the cumulative effect of initially applying the Standard, is recognised 
at the date of initial application. The same approach is adopted for all the leases.
(c) Comparative information are not restated and it is presented as reported under IND AS 17. The cumulative effect 
of initially applying this Standard, is done as an adjustment, to the opening balance of retained earnings, at the date 
of initial application.
(d) For the leases which is previously classified as operating lease, under IND AS 17, Company recognised the lease 
liability by measuring the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using incremental borrowing 
rate at the date of initial application.
(e) Company recognised, Right-of-use asset, at the date of initial application, for leases previously classified as an 
operating lease applying IND AS 17. Right-of-use asset is measured, on a lease by lease basis, at carrying amount 
assuming the standard is applied since the commencement date. Discounting to arrive the value of asset is done 
based on the incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application. Company also assessed the Right-of-use 
asset for impairment as per IND AS 36, Impairment of assets, at the date of initial application.
(f) During transition, no adjustments is made for leases for which the underlying asset is of low value.
(g) Company has applied a single discount rate for portfolio of leases which has reasonably similar characteristics.
(h) During transition, impact of IND AS 116 is not given for those leases for which the lease term ends within 12 
months of the date of initial application. Those leases were accounted as short term leases as per IND AS 116.
q)
 
Business Combination:
The Group applies the acquisition method in accounting for business combinations. The consideration transferred 
by the Group to obtain control of a business is calculated as the sum of the fair values of assets transferred and 
liabilities assumed as at the acquisition date i.e. date on which it obtains control of the acquiree, which includes the 
fair value of any asset or liability arising from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss as incurred, except to the extent related to the issue of debt or equity 
securities. 
Where the consideration transferred exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the 
excess is recorded as goodwill. Alternatively, in case of bargain purchase wherein the consideration transferred 
is lower than the fair value of the net identifiable assets and liabilities assumed, the difference as a gain in other 
comprehensive income and accumulate the gain in equity as capital reserve 
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values 
on acquisition-date. 
Intangible Assets acquired in a Business Combination and recognised separately from Goodwill are initially recognised 
at their fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost). 
Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a Business Combination are reported at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are 
acquired separately.
r)
 
Impairment of non-financial assets
Goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortization and are tested 
annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be 
impaired.
The carrying values of assets/cash generating units at each balance sheet date are reviewed for impairment if any 
indication of impairment exists. If the carrying amount of the assets exceed the estimated recoverable amount, an 
impairment is recognised for such excess amount.
The recoverable amount is the greater of the net selling price and their value in use. Value in use is arrived at by 
discounting the future cash flows to their present value based on an appropriate discount factor.
When there is indication that an impairment loss recognised for an asset (other than a revalued asset) in earlier 
accounting periods which no longer exists or may have decreased, such reversal of impairment loss is recognised in 
the consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, to the extent the amount was previously charged to the consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss. In case of revalued assets, such reversal is not recognised. An impairment loss in respect 
of goodwill is not subsequent reversed.
165
s)
 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalent in the consolidated balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-
term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value.
For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and 
short-term deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they are considered an integral 
part of the Group™s cash management.
t)
 
Taxation:
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. It is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent 
that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in OCI.
i.
 
Current tax
Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year 
and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. It is measured using 
tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Current tax also includes any tax arising 
from dividends.
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if, the Group:
a)
 
has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts; and
b)
 
intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
ii.
 
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax 
is not recognised for:
temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a 
business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;
temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and associates to the extent that the 
Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable 
that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary 
differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they 
can be used. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that 
it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised; such reductions are reversed when 
the probability of future taxable profits improves.
Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognised to the extent 
that it has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when 
they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in 
which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and 
liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if:
a)
 
the entity has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities; 
and
b)
 
the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same 
taxation authority on the same taxable entity.
Deferred tax asset / liabilities in respect of on temporary differences which originate and reverse during the 
tax holiday period are not recognised. Deferred tax assets / liabilities in respect of temporary differences 
that originate during the tax holiday period but reverse after the tax holiday period are recognised.
u)
 
Government grants
Grants received from the government are recognized at their fair value where there is reasonable assurance 
that the grant will be received and the Group will comply with the conditions.
166
Government grants related to income are deferred and recognized in the profit or loss over the period necessary 
to match them with the costs that they are intended to compensate and netted off with the expense in the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss.
Government grants related to purchase of property plant and equipment are recognised as deferred income 
and are credited to profit or loss on a straight line basis over expected life of the related asset and presented 
within other income.
v)
 
Provisions, Contingent Assets and Contingent Liabilities:
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows specific to the liability. The unwinding 
of the discount is recognised as finance cost. A provision for onerous contracts is measured at the present value 
of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the 
contract. Before a provision is established, the Group recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated 
with that contract.
A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that 
may, but will probably not, require an outflow of resources. When there is a possible obligation or a present 
obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is 
made.
A contingent asset is not recognised but disclosed in the consolidated financial statements where an inflow of 
economic benefit is probable.

C.
Financial risk management
The Company has exposure to the following risks arising from financial instruments:
*    Credit risk ;
*    Liquidity risk ; and
*    Market risk
i. Risk management framework
The Company™s Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's 
Risk Management Policy framework. The Board of Directors have adopted an Enterprise Risk Management 
Policy framed by the Group, which identifies the risk and lays down the risk minimisation procedures. The 
Management reviews the Risk Management Policies and systems on a regular basis to reflect changes in market 
conditions and the Group's activities, and the same is reported to the Board of Directors periodically. Further, 
the Group, in order to deal with the future risks, has in place various methods / processes which have been 
imbibed in its organisational structure and proper internal controls are in place to keep a check on lapses, and 
the same are been modified in accordance with the regular requirements.
The audit committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group™s Risk Management 
Policies and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the Risk Management framework in relation to the risks 
faced by the Group. The audit committee is assisted in its oversight role by internal auditors.
173
ii. Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to 
meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the group's receivables from customers and loans 
and advances.
The carrying amount of following financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure:
Trade receivables and loans and advances.
The group™s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer in 
which it operates. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously 
monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the group grants credit terms in the normal course of 
business.
The Risk Management Committee has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analysed 
individually for creditworthiness before the group™s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are 
offered. Further for domestic sales, the group segments the customers into Distributors and Others for credit 
monitoring.
The group maintains security deposits for sales made to its distributor For other trade receivables, the company 
individually monitors the sanctioned credit limits as against the outstanding balances. Accordingly, the group 
makes specific provisions against such trade receivables wherever required and monitors the same at periodic 
intervals.
The group monitors each loans and advances given and makes any specific provision wherever required.
The group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of 
trade receivables and loans and advances.

under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group™s 
reputation.

iv. Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices Œ such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices 
Œ will affect the Group™s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. Market risk is attributable to all 
market risk sensitive financial instruments including foreign currency receivables and payables and long term debt. 
We are exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and the market value 
of our investments. Thus, our exposure to market risk is a function of investing and borrowing activities and revenue 
generating and operating activities in foreign currency. The objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive 
exposure in our foreign currency revenues and costs.
175
Currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on account of its borrowings and other payables in foreign currency. The functional 
currency of the Group is Indian Rupee (
`
). The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk, most 
with a maturity of less than one year from the reporting date.
The currency profile of financial assets and financial liabilities as at March 31, 2020, March 31, 2019 are as below:

Sensitivity analysis
A reasonably possible strengthening (weakening) of the Foreign Currency against the Indian Rupee (
`
) at 31st March 
would have affected the measurement of financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies and affected equity 
and profit or loss by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest 
rates, remain constant and ignores any impact of forecast sales and purchases.

Interest rate risk:
Interest rate risk can be either fair value interest rate risk or cash flow interest rate risk. Fair value interest rate risk is the 
risk of changes in fair values of fixed interest bearing investments because of fluctuations in the interest rates. Cash flow 
interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of floating interest bearing investments will fluctuate because of 
fluctuations in the interest rates.
Exposure to interest rate risk
Group™s interest rate risk arises from borrowings. The interest rate profile of the Group™s interest-bearing financial 
instruments as reported to the management of the Group is as follows:

Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed-rate instruments
The Group does not account for any fixed-rate financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. 
Therefore, a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect profit or loss.
The Group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps. Under theses swaps, 
the Group agrees with other parties to exchange, the difference between fixed contract rates and floating rates interest 
amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional principal amounts
Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable-rate instruments
A reasonably possible change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased (decreased) 
profit or loss by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency 
exchange rates, remain constant.

The risk estimates provided assume a parallel shift of 100 basis points interest rate across all yield curves. This calculation 
also assumes that the change occurs at the balance sheet date and has been calculated based on risk exposures 
outstanding as at that date. The period end balances are not necessarily representative of the average debt outstanding 
during the period.

Capital Management
For the purpose of the Group's capital management, capital includes issued capital and other equity reserves. The 
primary objective of the Group™s Capital Management is to maximise shareholders value. The Group manages its 
capital structure and makes adjustments in the light of changes in economic environment and the requirements 
of the financial covenants.
The Group monitors capital using debt to equity ratio.

Hedge accounting
           
      
The Group's risk management policy is to hedge  its estimated foreign currency exposure in respect of highly 
probable forecast purchases and foreign currency borrowings. The Holding Company uses forward exchange 
contracts to hedge its currency risk and cross currency interest rate swap to hedge its interest rate and currency 
risk related to foreign currency borrowings. Such contracts are generally designated as cash flow hedges.
 
            
The Holding Company determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument 
and hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash flows. The Company assesses 
whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be and has been effective in 
offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method.
