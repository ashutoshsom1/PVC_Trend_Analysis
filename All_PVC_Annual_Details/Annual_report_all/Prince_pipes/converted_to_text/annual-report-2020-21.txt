Dear Shareholders,
The COVID-19 pandemic has been a human health, and 
economic crisis that has deeply affected millions around the 

world. The Central and State governments have been taking 

all measures to protect lives as well as livelihood to respond 

to the situation. I believe that it is one™s reaction to adversity, 

not adversity itself, that determines how the way forward will 

unfold. 
At Prince, we rose to challenges thrown by the pandemic 
and adapted swiftly across our networks to support our 
associates during this unprecedented time.  We focussed 
on protecting people™s health and safety, ensuring no job 

retrenchments, facilitated ‚work-from-home™, implemented 

strict sanitisation measures at plants and functioned with all 

extended members of our Prince Pariwaar to deal with the 

immediate impacts of the virus. Our Prince Pariwaar 

responded with complete commitment to surpass every 

challenge and I thank the full team for coming together in 
complete solidarity. 
Resilience has been a way of life at Prince Pipes. We were 
amongst the initial few companies to start dispatches as 

soon as partial lifting of lockdown was announced from Apr 

23, 2020. As we moved through the fiscal we responded 

with firm conviction to undertake several strategic efforts 

that enabled us to deliver phenomenal business growth and 

greater progress. With a resilient business model and a 

well-defined expansion strategy, Prince Pipes™ talented 

team, steered the company to report a robust set of 

numbers as we closed FY21. 
We have been able to beat the odds because we are 
passionate about our business and committed to create 

greater shareholder value. Even on the face of a second 

wave, we remained determined to advance. A sharp 

3-pronged strategy has been instrumental to this progress 

centered on organic growth, operational excellence and 

progress aligned to ESG goals.  
One of the key pillars of our strategies has been driving 

organic growth through market proximity and pan-India 
network expansion. Our seventh manufacturing facility 
launched much ahead of schedule in Sangareddy, 

Telangana this fiscal Œ plays an integral role at a time when 

the industry is witnessing consolidation. Strategically it 
allows us to further expand our distribution competence in 
the South. With over 1500 channel partners, we continue to 

steadily increase pan-India distributor base to ensure 

stronger customer proximity.
We also continue to bolster our presence in the Eastern 
India region through an asset light model by outsourcing the 
manufacture of high-volume low value PVC pipes, which 
allows efficient management of freight costs while 

strengthening our market share. In June 2020 we launched 

StoreFit water tanks majorly on an asset light model and also 
launched 4 additional products. including EASYFIT RE 
specially designed to divert waste water into a system where 

it can be recycled, CABLEFIT pipes manufactured using 

ultra-modern hi-tech machines for India™s rapidly growing 

infrastructural needs and GREENFIT PP-R systems 

designed for hot & cold water plumbing systems in buildings 

& Industrial piping installations. Our efforts in the B2B 

Projects segment are underway and we will first focus on 

building the right team to capitalise on industry 

opportunities.
Our focus on operational excellence has helped us achieve 
higher competitive advantages, optimise production 

processes and gain greater cost efficiencies.  This fiscal we 

forged key associations with global industry leaders Lubrizol 

- the inventors and world™s largest manufacturers of CPVC 

compounds and Tooling Holland BV Œ global leaders in 

mould manufacturing. These partnerships allow us to offer 
superior products aligned to global standards. A diversified 
product portfolio of 7200 SKUs, along with aggressive 

penetration of Prince Flowguard Plus following our 

marketing partnership with Lubrizol, helped drive both value 

expansion across products and volume growth in the 

plumbing and SWR categories. Prince Flowguard Plus 

continues to gain strong traction in urban, semi urban and 

Tier 2/3 regions. We have been able to engage with top 

quality distributors across the nation to cross sell PVC and 

CPVC systems with Prince which is a unique proposition in 

the industry today. 
Our aggressive marketing efforts have been much amplified 
through our brand ambassador actor Akshay Kumar, 

associated with the Prince brand since 2018. Various active 

brand monetisation initiatives are being implemented to 
support our drive for organisational excellence. I am 

delighted that our efforts have borne fruit as Prince Pipes 

was awarded Brand Of The Year Œ Pipes, by Reality+ INEX 
Awards 2021. 
Growth must be inclusive of the environment and 
sustainability. We are dedicated to manufacturing products 

which are smart, resourceful and pro-environment. Our ESG 

focus has also translated into visible outcomes as we 

reduced carbon footprint by 32% in one year, greenhouse 
gas emissions reduced by 23% over 4 years  and lead-free 
raw materials used for manufacture of plumbing pipes for 

drinking water, amongst other outcomes. To commemorate 

the World Plumbing Day, Prince Pipes has been the first to 

announce free personal accidental insurance worth Rs.5 

lakhs to our plumber associates. This was organized to 

honour their resilient spirit in current times.
CSR activities are conducted with full commitment and we 
ensure that either through our products or through 

meaningful activities, Prince Pipes makes a significant 

difference to society. While India grappled with oxygen 

shortage, we responded to the urgency of supporting the 

medical infrastructure of hospitals in Bihar, Rajasthan and 

Telangana by airlifting oxygen concentrators that were 

handed over to the respective states in the months of May 

and June 2021. As India battles the pandemic, I would like 
to assure you that we continue to stand with the nation 
during this challenging phase.
Clearly since the company™s listing in December 2019, 
Prince Pipes has persistently undertaken several 

growth-oriented initiatives to play out the company™s 

expansion plans, even on the face of the ongoing pandemic. 

It is with your unanimous support, a well-planned strategy 

and die-hard spirit that we remained unstoppable. This is in 

the same spirit that the world looks up to India for and which 

our country continues to uphold.  On behalf of the leadership 

team, I express deep gratitude for your continued 

encouragement throughout this journey.
I also thank all our people Œ our Prince Parivaar who have 
been tirelessly working to ensure business continuity and 

growth. Most importantly, I would like to thank you, our 

shareholders, for your trust, support, and confidence in 
Prince Pipes. I also express my sincere appreciation to 
every Board member for their valuable contribution and the 

management team for their commitment, drive, and passion 

in steering Prince Pipes towards profitable growth and 

operational excellence.

Telangana this fiscal Œ plays an integral role at a time when 

the industry is witnessing consolidation. Strategically it 
allows us to further expand our distribution competence in 
the South. With over 1500 channel partners, we continue to 

steadily increase pan-India distributor base to ensure 

stronger customer proximity.
We also continue to bolster our presence in the Eastern 
India region through an asset light model by outsourcing the 
manufacture of high-volume low value PVC pipes, which 
allows efficient management of freight costs while 

strengthening our market share. In June 2020 we launched 

StoreFit water tanks majorly on an asset light model and also 
launched 4 additional products. including EASYFIT RE 
specially designed to divert waste water into a system where 

it can be recycled, CABLEFIT pipes manufactured using 

ultra-modern hi-tech machines for India™s rapidly growing 

infrastructural needs and GREENFIT PP-R systems 

designed for hot & cold water plumbing systems in buildings 

& Industrial piping installations. Our efforts in the B2B 

Projects segment are underway and we will first focus on 

building the right team to capitalise on industry 

opportunities.
Our focus on operational excellence has helped us achieve 
higher competitive advantages, optimise production 

processes and gain greater cost efficiencies.  This fiscal we 

forged key associations with global industry leaders Lubrizol 

- the inventors and world™s largest manufacturers of CPVC 

compounds and Tooling Holland BV Œ global leaders in 

mould manufacturing. These partnerships allow us to offer 
superior products aligned to global standards. A diversified 
product portfolio of 7200 SKUs, along with aggressive 

penetration of Prince Flowguard Plus following our 

marketing partnership with Lubrizol, helped drive both value 

expansion across products and volume growth in the 

plumbing and SWR categories. Prince Flowguard Plus 

continues to gain strong traction in urban, semi urban and 

Tier 2/3 regions. We have been able to engage with top 

quality distributors across the nation to cross sell PVC and 

CPVC systems with Prince which is a unique proposition in 

the industry today. 
Our aggressive marketing efforts have been much amplified 
through our brand ambassador actor Akshay Kumar, 

associated with the Prince brand since 2018. Various active 

brand monetisation initiatives are being implemented to 
support our drive for organisational excellence. I am 

delighted that our efforts have borne fruit as Prince Pipes 

was awarded Brand Of The Year Œ Pipes, by Reality+ INEX 
Awards 2021. 
Growth must be inclusive of the environment and 
sustainability. We are dedicated to manufacturing products 

which are smart, resourceful and pro-environment. Our ESG 

focus has also translated into visible outcomes as we 

reduced carbon footprint by 32% in one year, greenhouse 
gas emissions reduced by 23% over 4 years  and lead-free 
raw materials used for manufacture of plumbing pipes for 

drinking water, amongst other outcomes. To commemorate 

the World Plumbing Day, Prince Pipes has been the first to 

announce free personal accidental insurance worth Rs.5 

lakhs to our plumber associates. This was organized to 

honour their resilient spirit in current times.
CSR activities are conducted with full commitment and we 
ensure that either through our products or through 

meaningful activities, Prince Pipes makes a significant 

difference to society. While India grappled with oxygen 

shortage, we responded to the urgency of supporting the 

medical infrastructure of hospitals in Bihar, Rajasthan and 

Telangana by airlifting oxygen concentrators that were 

handed over to the respective states in the months of May 

and June 2021. As India battles the pandemic, I would like 
to assure you that we continue to stand with the nation 
during this challenging phase.
Clearly since the company™s listing in December 2019, 
Prince Pipes has persistently undertaken several 

growth-oriented initiatives to play out the company™s 

expansion plans, even on the face of the ongoing pandemic. 

It is with your unanimous support, a well-planned strategy 

and die-hard spirit that we remained unstoppable. This is in 

the same spirit that the world looks up to India for and which 

our country continues to uphold.  On behalf of the leadership 

team, I express deep gratitude for your continued 

encouragement throughout this journey.
I also thank all our people Œ our Prince Parivaar who have 
been tirelessly working to ensure business continuity and 

growth. Most importantly, I would like to thank you, our 

shareholders, for your trust, support, and confidence in 
Prince Pipes. I also express my sincere appreciation to 
every Board member for their valuable contribution and the 

management team for their commitment, drive, and passion 

in steering Prince Pipes towards profitable growth and 

operational excellence.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS
1. GLOBAL ECONOMY
2. INDIAN ECONOMY
1.1. Outlook
The year 2020 spawned an unprecedented global crisis, with 
COVID-19 disrupting economies, Governments, and 

societies. Economic activities came to a grinding halt during 

the second quarter of 2020. The global economy is estimated 

to have contracted by 3.3% in 2020 (Source: World Economic 

Outlook).
Growth in advanced economies contracted by 4.7% in 2020 
and is projected to grow by 5.1% in 2021. Though the 

contraction was less severe than anticipated, a resurgence of 
COVID-19 dampened recovery. While fiscal policy is focused 
on stabilising the macro economy, Central bank frameworks 

are being reassessed as additional monetary policy support 

is limited. In the US, recovery was initially supported by 

substantial fiscal support to household incomes. However, 

the rebound was cut short by a resurgence of the pandemic. 

The situation looked the same for the Euro area and Japan, 

where countries were compelled to impose strict lockdown to 

contain the second surge of the pandemic. Tourism has been 

severely impacted, while manufacturing has continued to 

recover due to the strengthening of foreign demand. The 

ongoing lockdown and elevated restrictions across the UK 

will result in lower than pre-pandemic level growth in the 

economy.
For Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs), 
the IMF had projected a contraction of 2.2% in 2020 and a 

recovery of 6.7% in 2021. The drastically falling per capita 

income (90%) has pushed millions into poverty in the 

EMDEs. There has been a giant surge in the debt levels Œ 
both Government and of the private sector. Slow 
cross-border tourism and a subdued outlook for oil prices 

impacted economies depending on oil and tourism. In China, 

the economic recovery had been rapid yet sporadic with 

consumer services trailing industrial production. However, 

effective containment measures, forceful public investment 

response and liquidity support from the central bank resulted 

in a positive growth rate of 2.3% in 2020 for the country.
In low-income countries, growth shrank by 0.9% - stated to 
be the steepest decline in three decades. Weak state 

capacity and limited fiscal space have made it difficult for 

authorities to respond decisively to the pandemic. 

Government indebtedness increased as Government 
spending rose to address the health crisis and mitigate the 
adverse economic impacts.
The uncertainty across the globe was further accelerated by 
risks to financial stability Œ trade tensions, prolonged loose 

monetary conditions, rapid credit growth in some emerging 

economies and high debt levels. 
Global growth is projected to grow at 6% in 2021 and 
moderate to 4.4% during 2022 (Source: World Economic 
Outlook). Additional fiscal support in few large economies, 
anticipated vaccine-powered recovery in the second half of 

2021 and continued adaptation of economic activity are 
factors that would drive this growth. Advanced economies 
are projected to recover, with growth reaching 5.1% and 

3.6% in 2021 and 2022, respectively. The recovery will be 
aided by widespread vaccination and sustained monetary 
policy accommodation, which is expected to offset the 

partial unwinding of fiscal support. EMDEs are set to grow 

by 6.7% in 2021 mainly driven by growth in China followed 

by India. Growth is forecast to resume at a moderate pace in 

low-income countries as the vaccine rollout is expected to 

be slow.
India™s economy was in a deceleration phase even before 
the COVID-19 pandemic hit the country. Private 

consumption collapsed due to which firms began shelving 

their investments. The economy was facing significant 

decrease in industrial output, fall in tax revenues and a 

massive reduction in power demand, well before the impact 

of the lockdown was felt.
India recorded its first case of the virus on January 30, 
2020. As cases continued to rise, the Government of India 
imposed a nationwide lockdown on March 24, 2020. During 

the two-month (April-June) lockdown, India™s GDP 

contracted by 23.9%, the lowest in 24 years. For FY21, the 
economy contracted by 7.3%. Most sectors recorded 
negative growth due to curb on all activities. Agriculture 

reported a growth of 3.4% due to good monsoon and strong 
kharif sowing and rabi production. 
In response to the COVID-19 shock, the Government, and 
the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) took several monetary and 
fiscal policy measures to support vulnerable firms and 

households, expand service delivery (with increased 

spending on health and social protection) and cushion the 

impact of the crisis on the economy. The Reserve Bank of 

India (RBI) announced various measures to support 

liquidity, revive exports, and boost credit flow and ease of 

doing business in a bid to revive the economy. The Finance 

Ministry announced a 
˜
20 lakh crore economic stimulus 

package focusing on boosting manufacturing and 

strengthening supply chains. A relief of 
˜
1.70 lakh crore 

under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana was 

well-timed to target migrants and casual workers. The 

additional allocation of 
˜
10,000 crore in the latest package 

for Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Rozgar Yojana would 

further boost job creation in the rural sector and supplement 
rural incomes. Supported by these measures, the economy 
is expected to rebound, with a strong base effect 

materialising in FY22.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS
1. GLOBAL ECONOMY
2. INDIAN ECONOMY
1.1. Outlook
The year 2020 spawned an unprecedented global crisis, with 
COVID-19 disrupting economies, Governments, and 

societies. Economic activities came to a grinding halt during 

the second quarter of 2020. The global economy is estimated 

to have contracted by 3.3% in 2020 (Source: World Economic 

Outlook).
Growth in advanced economies contracted by 4.7% in 2020 
and is projected to grow by 5.1% in 2021. Though the 

contraction was less severe than anticipated, a resurgence of 
COVID-19 dampened recovery. While fiscal policy is focused 
on stabilising the macro economy, Central bank frameworks 

are being reassessed as additional monetary policy support 

is limited. In the US, recovery was initially supported by 

substantial fiscal support to household incomes. However, 

the rebound was cut short by a resurgence of the pandemic. 

The situation looked the same for the Euro area and Japan, 

where countries were compelled to impose strict lockdown to 

contain the second surge of the pandemic. Tourism has been 

severely impacted, while manufacturing has continued to 

recover due to the strengthening of foreign demand. The 

ongoing lockdown and elevated restrictions across the UK 

will result in lower than pre-pandemic level growth in the 

economy.
For Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs), 
the IMF had projected a contraction of 2.2% in 2020 and a 

recovery of 6.7% in 2021. The drastically falling per capita 

income (90%) has pushed millions into poverty in the 

EMDEs. There has been a giant surge in the debt levels Œ 
both Government and of the private sector. Slow 
cross-border tourism and a subdued outlook for oil prices 

impacted economies depending on oil and tourism. In China, 

the economic recovery had been rapid yet sporadic with 

consumer services trailing industrial production. However, 

effective containment measures, forceful public investment 

response and liquidity support from the central bank resulted 

in a positive growth rate of 2.3% in 2020 for the country.
In low-income countries, growth shrank by 0.9% - stated to 
be the steepest decline in three decades. Weak state 

capacity and limited fiscal space have made it difficult for 

authorities to respond decisively to the pandemic. 

Government indebtedness increased as Government 
spending rose to address the health crisis and mitigate the 
adverse economic impacts.
The uncertainty across the globe was further accelerated by 
risks to financial stability Œ trade tensions, prolonged loose 

monetary conditions, rapid credit growth in some emerging 

economies and high debt levels. 
Global growth is projected to grow at 6% in 2021 and 
moderate to 4.4% during 2022 (Source: World Economic 
Outlook). Additional fiscal support in few large economies, 
anticipated vaccine-powered recovery in the second half of 

2021 and continued adaptation of economic activity are 
factors that would drive this growth. Advanced economies 
are projected to recover, with growth reaching 5.1% and 

3.6% in 2021 and 2022, respectively. The recovery will be 
aided by widespread vaccination and sustained monetary 
policy accommodation, which is expected to offset the 

partial unwinding of fiscal support. EMDEs are set to grow 

by 6.7% in 2021 mainly driven by growth in China followed 

by India. Growth is forecast to resume at a moderate pace in 

low-income countries as the vaccine rollout is expected to 

be slow.
India™s economy was in a deceleration phase even before 
the COVID-19 pandemic hit the country. Private 

consumption collapsed due to which firms began shelving 

their investments. The economy was facing significant 

decrease in industrial output, fall in tax revenues and a 

massive reduction in power demand, well before the impact 

of the lockdown was felt.
India recorded its first case of the virus on January 30, 
2020. As cases continued to rise, the Government of India 
imposed a nationwide lockdown on March 24, 2020. During 

the two-month (April-June) lockdown, India™s GDP 

contracted by 23.9%, the lowest in 24 years. For FY21, the 
economy contracted by 7.3%. Most sectors recorded 
negative growth due to curb on all activities. Agriculture 

reported a growth of 3.4% due to good monsoon and strong 
kharif sowing and rabi production. 
In response to the COVID-19 shock, the Government, and 
the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) took several monetary and 
fiscal policy measures to support vulnerable firms and 

households, expand service delivery (with increased 

spending on health and social protection) and cushion the 

impact of the crisis on the economy. The Reserve Bank of 

India (RBI) announced various measures to support 

liquidity, revive exports, and boost credit flow and ease of 

doing business in a bid to revive the economy. The Finance 

Ministry announced a 
˜
20 lakh crore economic stimulus 

package focusing on boosting manufacturing and 

strengthening supply chains. A relief of 
˜
1.70 lakh crore 

under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana was 

well-timed to target migrants and casual workers. The 

additional allocation of 
˜
10,000 crore in the latest package 

for Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Rozgar Yojana would 

further boost job creation in the rural sector and supplement 
rural incomes. Supported by these measures, the economy 
is expected to rebound, with a strong base effect 

materialising in FY22.

Irrigation fund and a micro irrigation fund with an initial outlay 
of Rs. 450 billion for financing irrigation-related projects in the 
country. This will promote judicious use of water, enhance 
water use efficiency, improve production and productivity, and 

ultimately increase yield and earnings of India™s agricultural 
community.
The Government will play an active role in monitoring the 
progress of PMKSY projects, and has taken several steps to 
crystallise investments for irrigation:

for 26 states

irrigation 
plan 
(DIP) preparation. As many as 675 DIPs have been 
submitted from 692 districts. Based on the DIPs, each state is 
expected to submit a state irrigation plan (SIP)
According to CRISIL, investments in irrigation will rise 


CAGR over the past five years (April 1, 2014, to March 31, 
2019). Of the total investments in irrigation, construction 
expenditure is estimated at 75%, which accounts for Rs. 


the past five years. The rise in construction activity will 
provide the needed fillip to the pipes and fittings industry.
WSS and plumbing contribute 35-40% to the total PVC pipe 
market in India. Over the last five years, the Government has 

invested Rs. 416 billion in WSS led by several schemes such 

as Nal se Jal, a component of the Jal Jivan Mission, which 

promises piped drinking water to 14.6 crore rural households 

by 2024. During 2020-21, an allocation of Rs. 11,500 crores 

(15% more than the revised estimate for 2019-20) for 

connecting 1.15 crore households through functionally piped 

connections in rural areas, has been made. Under this 
programme, source sustainability measures for augmenting 
water supply through rainwater harvesting and groundwater 

recharge, and management of greywater for reusing 

wastewater, have been envisaged through gram panchayats 

which should play a crucial role in planning, designing, 

execution, operations, and maintenance of the in-village 

infrastructure. 
The Government is also focusing on cleaning rivers that are 

the main sources of water. It has allocated Rs. 800 crores to 

clean River Ganga under the Namami Gange programme 

and Rs. 840 crores to clean other rivers under the National 

River Conservation initiative. An amount of Rs. 60 lakh crores 

have been allocated for the Jal Jeevan Mission, which aims 

at improving access to water in India™s water-stressed 

districts.  
The Government has undertaken various programmes to 
boost infrastructure in urban areas. This will lead to a rise in 

demand for WSS and plumbing, in turn resulting in growth of 

the PVC pipes sector.
 
Swachh Bharat Mission:
 Swachh Bharat Mission and 
National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) are likely to 
boost investments in WSS. Swachh Bharat Mission 

focuses on construction of households, community, and 

public toilets, including conversion of insanitary latrines 

into pour-flush latrines.
The real estate sector is one of the prime consumers of 

plastic pipes and fittings. However, the onset of pandemic 

followed by a stringent nationwide lockdown imbued several 

challenges to the industry, bringing it to a temporary 

standstill. The period witnessed a decline in the sale of 

residential properties and commercial spaces. 

announced relief measures. The Aatmanirbhar Bharat 
campaign was strengthened by RBI™s announcement of loan 
moratoriums. Stamp duty cuts and reduction in loan rates 

continues to aid real estate developers during these volatile 

times. Ease in investment opportunities through flexibility in 

REITs and tax reliefs boosted market sentiments and today, 

the sector is on its road to recovery with homebuyers and 

investors returning to the market. The implementation of Real 

Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) has helped boost 

investments in real estate enhancing transparency, financial 

discipline and driving greater efficiency, while the Pradhan 

Mantri Aawas Yojana (PMAY) is working towards minimising 
housing shortage amongst the urban poor. Several tax 

benefits such as reduction in GST rate on affordable homes 

to 1%, under construction homes to 5% with zero GST for 

ready homes and hiking exemption limit of interest on home 

loans to Rs. 3.5 lakh have provided further impetus to 

affordable and mid-income housing.
The real estate sector in India is expected to reach a market 
size of US$ 1 trillion by 2030 from US$ 120 billion in 2017 and 

contribute 13% to the country™s GDP by 2025.
Growth drivers for the sector

 
REITs market to drive investment momentum:
 Listing 
of new REITs is expected to provide opportunities for 
institutional investors to build asset portfolios or co-invest 
with existing platforms before the IPO. The provision of 
the Union Budget 2021-22, allowing to raise debt from 

foreign portfolio investors at low cost will lead to more 

asset acquisitions by REITs. Office assets are expected 

to the preferred option due to stable rental yields and 

income visibility. 
 
Atal Mission for Rejuvenation & Urban 
Transformation (AMRUT):
 AMRUT focuses on 
providing basic infrastructure services such as water 

supply, sewerage, storm water drains, transport and 

development of green spaces and parks.

 The main objective of the
 
Mission is to promote cities that provide core 
infrastructure, clean and sustainable environment and 

give a respectable quality of life to their citizens through 
the application of 'smart solutions'. Core infrastructure 
elements of a smart city include adequate water supply, 

sanitation, and affordable housing. 
Overall WSS investments are likely to be Rs. 2,924 billion over the next five years
(April 1, 2019, to March 31, 2024) (Source: CRISIL).

5. BUSINESS STRENGTHS


FMCG:
 The IT/ITeS sector has been largely unaffected 
by the economic downturn and continued to account for 

majority of the office leasing in 2020. At the same time, 
there was increased traction from sectors such as 
e-commerce, healthcare and FMCG. In the coming year, 

the IT/ITeS sector will be the key occupier group, while 
demand from the other sectors is likely to increase.

 Occupants are 
increasingly demanding high-quality, tech-enabled, and 
wellness- enhancing buildings. The enhanced focus on 

health and safety will lead to use of advanced technology 

to provide cleaner buildings, sensors, touchless entry, 

and contact tracing apps. This will lead to a trajectory of 

graded office developments. Furthermore, the 

reimagination and upgradation of outdated office spaces, 

especially in the larger markets of Bengaluru, Delhi NCR 

and Mumbai may become a defining theme from 2021 

onwards.


 The pandemic reinforced the desire 

to own a home to avoid the uncertainties of living in 

rented accommodations. Moreover, while end users 

continue to drive demand, there is renewed interest from 

investors and from Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) 

impacted by economic uncertainties in Europe and the 

Middle East.


CPVC pipes in India are still at a nascent stage, even though 
the demand for the CPVC category has been the highest 

amongst pipes over FY 14-FY 19, due to its inherent 

advantages. The following attributes of CPVC pipes creates 

more affinity and demand for purposes of replacement and 

substitution:   

 CPVC pipe and fittings 
demonstrate superior resistance to internal and external 
corrosion, virtually eliminating process leaks, flow 

restrictions and ultimately, premature pipe failure. They 

are pitting and scaling resistant and can weather extreme 

temperatures and aggressive chemicals.

 CPVC pipes and fittings are 
installed using a simple two-step solvent-cementing 
process. They are lightweight, weighing roughly 
one-eighth the weight of comparably sized steel piping. 

Moreover, their installation does not require electricity, 
which makes them ideal for applications where power 
cuts are frequent.

 CPVC piping has a smooth inner 
surface that resists scaling and fouling. It offers optimum 

flow rates, allowing more liquid to move, using smaller 
pumps and less energy.

 CPVC has a flash ignition 
temperature of 900°F (482°C), which is the lowest 
temperature at which combustible gas can be ignited by 

a small, external flame. It has an exceptionally high 

limiting oxygen index (LOI)Šthe percentage of oxygen 

needed in the atmosphere to support combustion. 

 CPVC 
pipes and fittings restrict bacterial growth, which keeps 

the water quality healthy. They are suitable even for 

aggressive water pH levels of less than 6.5.

 The CPVC system 
is four times quieter than copper plumbing systems, 

reducing not only the sound of running water, but also 

the pounding noise of the water hammer. Its 

thermoplastic properties provide excellent insulation to 

virtually eliminate sweating and condensation. It keeps 

hot water hotter and cold water colder than copper 

plumbing. There is minimal energy loss through pipe 

walls, saving money on heating and cooling.

5. BUSINESS STRENGTHS


FMCG:
 The IT/ITeS sector has been largely unaffected 
by the economic downturn and continued to account for 

majority of the office leasing in 2020. At the same time, 
there was increased traction from sectors such as 
e-commerce, healthcare and FMCG. In the coming year, 

the IT/ITeS sector will be the key occupier group, while 
demand from the other sectors is likely to increase.

 Occupants are 
increasingly demanding high-quality, tech-enabled, and 
wellness- enhancing buildings. The enhanced focus on 

health and safety will lead to use of advanced technology 

to provide cleaner buildings, sensors, touchless entry, 

and contact tracing apps. This will lead to a trajectory of 

graded office developments. Furthermore, the 

reimagination and upgradation of outdated office spaces, 

especially in the larger markets of Bengaluru, Delhi NCR 

and Mumbai may become a defining theme from 2021

Strong execution track record:
 The Company has 
structured quick turnaround time (TAT) for products to 
promptly cater to the evolving needs of clients. Our Jaipur 
plant [launched in 2019] and the recently launched Telangana 

plant [in 2020] were established much ahead of schedule, 
demonstrating agile execution capabilities even during the 
pandemic.  The roll-out of new products within the first two 

quarters of 2020 which was within 3 months of partial 
opening of the lockdown,  the mobilisation of the team and 
market resources, further demonstrates our agile execution 

approach.
Resilient performance:
 Driven by a resilient business 
model, our operations have been relatively less impacted by 

the pandemic. The Company has reported robust operational 

and financial performance across FY 20-21, undertaking 

several growth-oriented efforts that continue to deliver strong 

outcomes. 
Over the second, third and fourth quarters of FY 2020, the 
Company continued to report robust performance amidst the 

existing pandemic situation. Efforts were driven by sharp 

focus on the Agri & Plumbing segments and efficient cost 

optimization measures that resulted into healthy growth and 

margin protection. Undaunted by the external circumstances 

and while ensuring all Covid protocols, the Company 

continued to implement several future-oriented initiatives. 

During the second quarter it established key strategic 

associations with global industry leaders to expand market 

leadership and manufacturing expertise, leverage its 

distribution excellence and strengthen competitive agility to 

respond to India™s evolving needs in the piping systems 

industry.
Robust controls and processes, strict audit systems 
ensure financial health:
 The Company™s Internal and 

statutory auditors ensure adequate internal controls are in 

place with the periodic stringent reviews in regular intervals. 

Since the pandemic hit the nation in March 2020, the 

Company initiated various cost control measures during the 

COVID period that translated into strong performance of 

operating margins and profitability.
Prince Pipes™ overall organisational progress, and strong 
growth momentum has been reflected in the improvement in 

both long and short-term ratings from Crisil. Long term rating 

improved from A-(Stable) to A with positive outlook and 

short-term rating improved from A2+ to A1 wef July 20, 2021.
The Company™s prudent financial management has 

translated into a substantial reduction of debt. The 
long-term debt has been completely paid off. Additionally, 
the cost of borrowings have also been rationalised.
Collaborating with global players to remain ahead of 
industry:
 In September 2020 Prince Pipes announced a 

collaboration with Lubrizol [headquartered in the US] - the 
world™s largest manufacturers and inventors of CPVC 
compounds. Prince Pipes™ robust distribution network 

combined with Lubrizol™s brand equity has created a strong 
and sustainable partnership in the piping Industry. The 

association has been delivering encouraging performance 
with Prince Flowguard Plus plumbing systems gaining strong 
traction in urban, semi urban, and Tier 2/3 regions. Prince 

Flowguard Plus has also gained strong brand recall in our 

private projects segment which is now in the process of being 

scaled up to allow the Company to capitalise on the huge 

existing industry potential
The Company also announced a technical collaboration in 
July 2020 with Tooling Holland BV [based in The 

Netherlands] - a global leader in plastic mould manufacturing 

association. This will enable Prince Pipes to draw upon 

Tooling Holland™s technical expertise and deep knowledge, 

build skills at par with international standards, significantly 

enhance internal operational efficiencies and optimize 

production costs.
Seeking growth, the ESG way:
 The challenging times 
during the pandemic showcased the value of environment, 

sustainability and cleanliness. Prince Pipes is dedicated to 

manufacturing products which are smart, resourceful and 

pro-environment. Our environment-focussed efforts reiterates 

our performance as a steward of nature. Our ESG focus 

continues to deliver encouraging results as we reduced 

carbon footprint by 32% in one year and greenhouse gas 

emissions reduced by 23% over 4 years. Traditional energy 

saved due to use of solar power is equivalent to 2.7 m 

pounds of coal burned every year translating to low carbon 

footprint. Due to solar energy used, the Company planted 

40,000 saplings over the last 10 years. The Company™s piping 

and plumbing systems are manufactured using lead-free raw 

materials and the Company is making conscious efforts to 

source local raw material. 
All our plants are ISO 14001:2015 certified from TUV 

Rheinland, Germany. Most of our plants are installed with 
solar panels and our efforts to harness wind energy through 
collaborations at the Chennai plant are on-going. All our 

plants are also certified for ISO 50001:2018 energy 
management systems. We have implemented effective 
Energy Management System (EnMS) across all our sites 

since 2017 and achieved certification from TUV Rheinland, 
Germany.
Our efforts extend to empower social capital through the 
fiscal, focused on skill development, increasing employability, 
and improving customer service abilities, through initiatives 

including plumber education efforts

Our engagement with plumbers allows us to reach out to 

thousands of utility service providers educating them on 

various aspects of solvent applications, new techniques, soft 

skills, and product usage to better their service capabilities. 

Blood donation camps are arranged periodically and a 

special initiative #Weareinitogether was organised which 

donated domestic essentials to plant operators and staff.
Our governance systems are fully aligned to our core values 
centred on ethical standards, respect, transparency, 

commitment to quality and ownership. The Company™s core 

values have been non-negotiable over its 3-decade journey 

and will continue to remain so.  Regular audits of systems, 

processes and facilities, a balanced approach towards 

preserving the interests of all stakeholders including 

shareholders, senior management executives, customers, 

suppliers, financiers, the government, and the community, 

have held us in good stead.
Staying ahead of the curve:
 
Since inception, the Company 
has taken a proactive, agile stance executing strategic 
initiatives to stay ahead of industry and that has helped us 

build a unique and differentiated position . This has 

compelled us all to take personal responsibility for remaining 

resilient and progressive even in the face of relentless 

change. In January 2021, the Company inaugurated its 

seventh manufacturing facility in Sangareddy, Telangana 

much ahead of schedule. The state-of-the-art manufacturing 

unit is expected to have a total installed capacity of 

approximately 50,000 metric tons per annum to come up in 
phases over the next 2 to 3 years. The facility will cater to 
Southern markets, as PPFL aggressively continues to 

expand its pan-India marketing, distribution, and 

manufacturing presence.
In 2020 amidst the pandemic, the Company forged important 
alliances with global industry leaders to strengthen its 
leadership position and offer products of global standards. 

The tie up with Lubrizol to form CPVC compounds and 
market the brand Prince FlowGuard Plus., which is today well 
accepted in the markets. Our partnership with Tooling 

Holland, BV is benefitting us with technical knowledge and 

global standards of moulds, helping us drive our quality 
several notches higher.
In 2014, we forayed into Eastern India being early movers to 
the region, that has largely build great cost efficiencies 

through a unique asset light model, helping us reduce freight 
costs. The Company was also the first in the pipes and fittings 
industry to venture into North India and set up a plant at 

Haridwar, in 2008.
Resilient performance:
 The Company has remained 
focussed on maintaining business continuity throughout the 

last fiscal, while protecting staff, contributing to society, and 

also preserving profitability and margins. We were amongst 

the initial few companies to start dispatches as soon as 

partial lifting of lockdown was announced from Apr 23, 2020. 

Being agile we responded with firm conviction to take several 

strategic actions that helped us deliver robust business 

growth and firm industry position. Driven by a resilient 

business model, a well-charted expansion strategy and a 

wide portfolio of over 7200 SKUs, the Company has 

successfully reported a robust set of numbers as we closed 

FY2020-21, being one of the fastest growing companies in 

the industry.
Strategic expansion of distribution network:
 The success 
of our business strategy continues to rest on 3 factors:  our 

seven strategically located plants, our unique outsourcing 

strategy for Eastern India and the pan-India extensive reach 

through distributors and channel partners. Since freight is a 

significant entity of our cost structure, all manufacturing units 

are located near raw material sources, ports, and principal 

markets to improve cost efficiencies. A unique outsourcing 

strategy for Eastern India has been to establish partners in 

the region, which has allowed the Company to adopt an 

asset light model in conjunction with its manufacturing 

abilities. A key factor contributing to the expanding presence 

can be attributed to our extensive 
distribution network with

also preserving profitability and margins. We were amongst 

the initial few companies to start dispatches as soon as 

partial lifting of lockdown was announced from Apr 23, 2020. 

Being agile we responded with firm conviction to take several 

strategic actions that helped us deliver robust business 

growth and firm industry position. Driven by a resilient 

business model, a well-charted expansion strategy and a 

wide portfolio of over 7200 SKUs, the Company has 

successfully reported a robust set of numbers as we closed 

FY2020-21, being one of the fastest growing companies in 

the industry.
Strategic expansion of distribution network:
 The success 
of our business strategy continues to rest on 3 factors:  our 

seven strategically located plants, our unique outsourcing 

strategy for Eastern India and the pan-India extensive reach 

through distributors and channel partners. Since freight is a 

significant entity of our cost structure, all manufacturing units 

are located near raw material sources, ports, and principal 

markets to improve cost efficiencies. A unique outsourcing 

strategy for Eastern India has been to establish partners in 

the region, which has allowed the Company to adopt an 

asset light model in conjunction with its manufacturing 

abilities. A key factor contributing to the expanding presence 

can be attributed to our extensive 
distribution network with

aggressively, through various channels such as customer 
loyalty programs, below the line (BTL) promotions, above the 

line (ATL) promotions and social media communications. The 

cumulative efficacy of all branding and marketing efforts have 
led to Prince Pipes and Fittings being awarded Brand of The 
Year Œ Pipes by INEX Realty+. 
Targeted brand engagement campaigns with one of our core 
associates -- the plumber community has driven stronger 

engagement with this segment who we consider our key 

endorsers. In March 2021, Mirchi & Prince Pipes celebrated 

the spirit of plumbers across India on World Plumbing Day.  

To commemorate the day and as a gesture of 

acknowledgment to all plumbers, a singing contest was 
launched for plumbers across nine cities in Delhi, Mumbai, 
Hyderabad, Kolkata and Ahmedabad, Pune, Jaipur, 

Lucknow, and Patna. The response was phenomenal and out 

of the thousands of plumber entries submitted, one lucky 

winner per city received ration supplies worth Rs. 20,000/- 

courtesy Prince Pipes. The winners were also invited to the 
Radio Mirchi studios to interact with some of the station™s 
most popular Radio Jockeys. 
Mirchi created five videos with the winning plumbers that 
showcased their die-hard spirit and celebrated their 

contribution and lives with aplomb. Such focussed 

campaigns are contributing to strengthen customer 

engagement as well as brand recall. 
To enhance top-of-mind recall, in July 2020 Prince Pipes 
renewed its association with leading actor Akshay Kumar, 

who has been the brand ambassador for Prince Pipes since 

2018. The Company also extended this association for the 

water tank segment StoreFit, launched in June 2020 which is 

expected to grow at a high pace. The Prince Pipes brand 

portfolio resonates powerfully with Akshay™s ability to reach 

out to our industry participants across India, especially in Tier 

2/3 regions and hyper local domains.
Over the next five years, we have charted a social media 
strategy to create better understanding of the Company and 

strengthen its industry position. This is being implemented by 

developing separate websites for Prince Piping Systems and 

Trubore and focus on digital and mobile solutions through 

social media platforms of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
One of the key pillars of our growth and expansion strategies 
expanding our dealer and distributor network. With the aim of 
connecting with our dealers and partners which is crucial to 

our growth, we conduct Parivaar and Mitra Meets for dealers, 

plumbers, channel partners and others to influence the 

community, educate the audiences on key industry trends, 
progress of Company and introduce new products.
Enhancing Resource Productivity:
 At Prince, there are 
three key processes that occur in organizational learning: 
Knowledge creation, Knowledge retention, and Knowledge 

transfer. The Company ensures that the knowledge gained 

from this process is retained within the organization and is 

transferable. The Human Resource teams ensure that 

programs are facilitated that allows knowledge transfer to 

build ‚embedded knowledge™ that can be kept within the 
organization and shared amongst teams to build greater 
resource productivity. 
Across the fiscal. we covered staff and associate categories 
across locations under various categories of trainings 

spanning technical, behavioural & awareness to upgrade 

their knowledge and further enhance capabilities. We 

introduced virtual learning platform and modalities to ensure 
continuous learning for the sales force. Focussed modules 
were developed to engage the sales teams in sales 

interactions, Know Your Product, Dimensions of Professional 

Selling, Financial & Commercial Management, which have 

started delivering better performance.
The company also introduced a Knowledge Retention 
Framework for sustainable learning sustainability, 
commenced an Organisational Culture Building initiative 

covering around 500 staff members across locations, 

towards paving the way for a ﬁFuture Ready Princeﬂ.
Innovation and Leadership:
 Over 3 decades, the Company 
has built deep knowledge and competitive advantage of 

handling multiple polymers, transitioning beyond PVC pipes. 

Today, the journey as evolved into a larger mission of creating 

innovations in plumbing, irrigation, storage, and sewerage 

technologies to meet India™s growing water management 

needs. The Company is therefore, one of India™s largest PVC 

pipes manufacturer engaged in the manufacturing of multi 

polymer pipes and fittings through production of polymer 

pipes - CPVC, UPVC, HDPE, PPR and fittings - CPVC, PPR, 

and UPVC. Driven by an innovative attitude, the Company 

continues to build an evolving product portfolio with the 

largest range of over 7200 SKUs across multiple polymers.

Foreign exchange

We import some raw materials and 
equipment used in our manufacturing 

plants. Any unfavourable movements in 

the exchange rate would impact our 
performance.
The Indian Government has imposed 
an antidumping duty (ADD) on CPVC 

resin / compound imports from China 

and Korea for a period of five years 

(valid up to February 2025). This move 

is followed by provisional anti-dumping 

duty announced on August 26, 2019. 
The industry™s share of imports from 
China and South Korea stood at about 

33% of the total imports between 

April-August 2019.

challenges and opportunities, to introduce new 

products and variants of existing products. The 

team has regular interactions with plumbing 

consultants and contractors to understand the 

demand for pipes and fittings products.
We constantly evaluate exchange rate exposure 
arising from foreign currency transactions. We 

enter into a variety of derivative financial 

instruments such as foreign exchange forward 

contracts, interest rate swaps and 

cross-currency swaps to mitigate this risk.
Earlier, CPVC resin was sourced from various 
geographies, including Korea, China, japan   
and Europe. Post Government regulation, the 
Company has stopped sourcing the same from 

China and Korea. Since our raw material 

imports are not concentrated from these 

geographies, we have been able to mitigate

this risk to a large extent.
We purchase raw materials from domestic 
suppliers on credit terms of less than a week 
and purchase imported raw materials on credit 
terms of 90-150 days. However, the standard 
payment term with distributors is generally 
between 15-30 days. We use working capital 

facilities to fund the timing difference between 

the payment for raw materials and the receipt of 

payment for manufactured products. In addition, 

we also use channel financing to optimise the 

working capital requirements and improve 

collections/debtor days.

Mitigation
As one of India™s leading pipe and fittings manufacturers, we 
are vested with the important responsibility of being a good 
corporate citizen and ensuring we do not adversely impact 
the environment and the communities in which we operate. 

We consider success as inclusive of both aspects of 
profitability and sustainability. We focus on the Triple Bottom 
Line goals of environmental, social, and financial 

performance to ensure sustainable value creation for all 
stakeholders.
At Prince Pipes, Product Life Cycle Assessment [PLCA] has 
become a tool of choice used to establish the sustainability 
impact of the products we manufacture and market. Across 
all stages of the product life cycle, we assimilate very clear 

avenues where we can reduce the environmental impact, 

create social capital and achieve cost efficiency.

9. SUSTAINABILITY
Foreign exchange
Changing 
regulations and 

policies
Credit
We import some raw materials and 
equipment used in our manufacturing 

plants. Any unfavourable movements in 

the exchange rate would impact our 
performance.
The Indian Government has imposed 
an antidumping duty (ADD) on CPVC 

resin / compound imports from China 

and Korea for a period of five years 

(valid up to February 2025). This move 

is followed by provisional anti-dumping 

duty announced on August 26, 2019. 
The industry™s share of imports from 
China and South Korea stood at about 

33% of the total imports between 

April-August 2019.
Majority of our sales to distributors are 
on an open credit basis, with standard 

payment period between 15-30 days. 

Inability to collect the receivables could 

adversely affect our performance.
challenges and opportunities, to introduce new 

products and variants of existing products. The 

team has regular interactions with plumbing 

consultants and contractors to understand the 

demand for pipes and fittings products.
We constantly evaluate exchange rate exposure 
arising from foreign currency transactions. We 

enter into a variety of derivative financial 

instruments such as foreign exchange forward 

contracts, interest rate swaps and 

cross-currency swaps to mitigate this risk.
Earlier, CPVC resin was sourced from various 
geographies, including Korea, China, japan   
and Europe. Post Government regulation, the 
Company has stopped sourcing the same from 

China and Korea. Since our raw material 

imports are not concentrated from these 

geographies, we have been able to mitigate

this risk to a large extent.
We purchase raw materials from domestic 
suppliers on credit terms of less than a week 
and purchase imported raw materials on credit 
terms of 90-150 days. However, the standard 
payment term with distributors is generally 
between 15-30 days. We use working capital 

facilities to fund the timing difference between 

the payment for raw materials and the receipt of 

payment for manufactured products. In addition, 

we also use channel financing to optimise the 

working capital requirements and improve 

collections/debtor days.
Types of risks
Risk description
Mitigation
As one of India™s leading pipe and fittings manufacturers, we 
are vested with the important responsibility of being a good 
corporate citizen and ensuring we do not adversely impact 
the environment and the communities in which we operate. 

We consider success as inclusive of both aspects of 
profitability and sustainability. We focus on the Triple Bottom 
Line goals of environmental, social, and financial 

performance to ensure sustainable value creation for all 
stakeholders.
At Prince Pipes, Product Life Cycle Assessment [PLCA] has 
become a tool of choice used to establish the sustainability 
impact of the products we manufacture and market. Across 
all stages of the product life cycle, we assimilate very clear 

avenues where we can reduce the environmental impact, 

create social capital and achieve cost efficiency.
9.1. Focusing on clean energy 
and environment
From procurement of raw materials, to ensuring sustainable 
manufacturing facilities, until distribution, our resources are 

used with the aim of valuing our larger communities and the 

environment. Some of our  key efforts have been directed as

ended March 31, 2021 pursuant to Regulation 34 of the SEBI 

(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 

2015 and SEBI notification dated November 4, 2015.
The disclosures on Business Responsibility are aligned with 
the nine principles of National Voluntary Guidelines on Social, 

Environmental and Economic Responsibilities of Business, as 

notified by the Ministry of Corporate affairs (‚MCA™), Government 

of India.
Over the years, the Company has been striving to build and 
maintain a strong structure by bringing together strengths to 

unlock new avenues for growth and delivering a more diversified 

suite of products and services to meet the needs of a growing 

India. We are committed towards constant innovations in 

plumbing, irrigation and sewerage technologies to meet the 

nation™s constantly increasing water demands. We aim to pave 

the way for a future that provides clean water for everyone and 

everywhere; from the smallest villages to the largest cities. 

With the use of Manufacturing process to create extremely 

efficient piping systems, we aim at low-cost, non-contaminated 

water transport in every part of the country. The Company™s 

underground drainage systems provide hassle-free sewerage for 

every situation.
Thus, the culture of and awareness regarding catering to 
environmental, social, health and safety needs are imbibed in 
the very nature of the Company™s business model. We embrace 
environmental and social responsibility while creating value for 
our stakeholders.
The Company™s philosophy on each principle is reproduced 
below:
Principle 1: Businesses should conduct and govern themselves 
with Ethics, Transparency and Accountability
We believe that for a successful and sustainable business, a strong 
foundation of ethical corporate citizenship and establishment of 
good corporate culture is essential. We are committed to operate 
our business ethically in a manner such that all stakeholders i.e. 
investors, creditors, distributors, customers, employees, and even 
competitors, the government and the society at large, are dealt 
with in a fair manner. We have always believed in adhering to the 
best governance practices to ensure protection of interests of all 

stakeholders of the Company in tandem with healthy growth of 
the Company.
 
The Company strives to maintain high standards of ethics in all 
spheres of its business activities. The Board of Directors and 
Senior Management strive and endeavor to set examples of 
utmost ethical behavior.
The Company™s core management team aims at inculcating 
ethical behavior at all levels across the Company making it an 

essential part of the work culture so that every employee of the 

Company conducts himself with professionalism, honesty and 

integrity, and conforms to high moral and ethical grounds.
The Company has in place a Human Resources Manual covering 
internal code of conduct and business ethics which every 

employee needs to abide by. We ensure that genuine concerns of 

misconduct/ unlawful conduct can be reported in a responsible 

and confidential manner through the Company™s Vigil Mechanism. 

We also encourage our business partners and third parties with 

whom we conduct business to abide by this policy.
Further, the Company also encourages transparency of operations 
by ensuring that the statutory disclosures are governed by 

the Code of Practices and Procedures for Fair Disclosure of 

Unpublished Price Sensitive Information, Determination of 

Materiality Policy, etc. The Company also regularly publishes 

necessary disclosures, investor presentations and important

issues raised as promptly as possible, being accountable for its 

actions.

business dealings and it believes in free and open competition 

and does not encourage any anti-competitive or unfair practice.
Principle 2: Businesses should provide goods and services that

present, without compromising the ability of future generations 

to meet their own needs. The Company endeavours to implement 

the principles of sustainability into the various stages of product or 

service lifecycle, including procurement of raw material/ service, 

manufacturing products or delivery of service, transportation of 

raw materials and finished goods, and disposal by consumers.

institutional change are in harmony and enhance both current 

and future potential to meet the human needs and aspirations.

We have audited the accompanying Ind AS financial statements of Prince Pipes and Fittings Limited (ﬁthe Companyﬂ), which comprise 
the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2021, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement 

of Changes in Equity and the Cash Flow Statement for the year then ended, and notes to the Ind AS financial statements, including 

a summary of the significant accounting policies and other explanatory information (herein after referred to as ﬁInd AS financial 

statementsﬂ).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Ind AS financial statements give the 
information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (ﬁthe Actﬂ) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with 

the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2021, its profit (including 

other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities 
under those SAs are further described in the Auditor™s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Ind AS financial statements section of our 

report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 

India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the provisions of the Act 

and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code 

of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the Ind AS financial 
statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Ind AS financial statements as a whole, 

and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Description of Key Audit Matters:
Key Audit Matters
How the matter was addressed in our Audit
Provision for Discount & Incentives

Revenue is measured net of discounts, incentives and rebates 
given to the customers on the Company™s sales.
The Company™s presence across different marketing regions 

within the country and the competitive business environment 

makes the assessment of various type of discounts and 

incentives as complex and judgmental.
Given the complexity and judgement required to assess the 

provision for discounts and incentives, this is a key audit matter.
Our audit procedures included:
We have assessed the Company™s accounting policies relating 
to revenue, discounts, incentives and rebate by comparing with 

applicable Ind AS.  
We have assessed the Company™s computations for accrual of 

discounts incentives and rebates. 
On a sample basis, checked the accruals made with the 

approved schemes and underlying documents.
We have compared the historical trend of discounts and 

incentives to provisions made to assess the current year 

accruals.
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR™S REPORT
96
Other Information
The Company™s Management and Board of Director are 
responsible for the other information. The Other information 

comprises the information included in the company™s annual 

report, but does not include the financial statements and our 

auditor™s report thereon. The other information is expected to be 

made available to us after the date of this auditor™s report.
 
 
  

Our opinion on the accompanying Ind AS financial statements 

does not cover the other information and we do not express any 

form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the accompanying Ind AS financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, 

in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially 

inconsistent with accompanying Ind AS financial statements or 

our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be 

materially misstated.
When we read the other information included in the Company™s 
annual report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement 

therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those 

charged with governance. 
Management™s Responsibility for the Ind AS Financial 
Statements 
The Company™s Management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with 

respect to the preparation of these Ind AS financial statements 

that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs, profit and other 

comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the 

Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally 

accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (ﬁInd 

ASﬂ) prescribed under Section 133 of the Act. This responsibility 

also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in 

accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the 

assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds 

and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate 

accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that 

are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and 

maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were 

operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness 

of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and 

presentation of the Ind AS financial statements that give a true 

and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether 

due to fraud or error.
In preparing the Ind AS financial statements, management and 
Board of Directors are responsible for assessing the Company™s 

ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, 

matters related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless management either intends to 

liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic 

alternative but to do so.
The Company™s Management and Board of Directors are also 
responsible for overseeing the Company™s financial reporting 

process.
Auditor™s Responsibility for the Audit of the Ind AS Financial 
Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the Ind AS financial statements as whole are free from material 

misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an 

auditor™s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 

is a high level assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 

conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material 

misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 

fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in 

aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 

economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Ind AS 

Financial Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 

throughout the audit. We also: 
1.
 
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of 
the Ind AS financial statements, whether due to fraud or 

error, design and perform audit procedures responsive 

to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 

and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk 

of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 

fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud 

may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 

misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 
2.
 
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 

the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 

appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)

(i) of the Companies Act, 2013, we are also responsible 

for expressing our opinion on whether the company has 

adequate internal financial controls with reference to Ind AS 

financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness 

of such controls. 
3.
 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 

and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 

disclosures made by Management and Board of Directors. 
4.
 
Conclude on the appropriateness of Management and Board 

of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting 

and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a 
97
material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions 
that may cast significant doubt on the Company™s ability to 

continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material 

uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our 

auditor™s report to the related disclosures in the Ind AS 

financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, 

to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the 

audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor™s 

report. However, future events or conditions may cause the 

Company to cease to continue as a going concern. 
5.
 
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of 

the Ind AS financial statements, including the disclosures, 

and whether the Ind AS financial statements represent 

the underlying transactions and events in a manner that 

achieves fair presentation. 
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, 

among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the 

audit and significant audit findings, including any significant 

deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement 
that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 

regarding independence, and to communicate with them all 

relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought 

to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related 

safeguards. 
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 

significance in the audit of the Ind AS financial statements of 

the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We 

describe these matters in our auditor™s report unless law or 

regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 

in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter 

should not be communicated in our report because the adverse 

consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to 

outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Opinion
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference 
to Ind AS financial statements of the Prince Pipes and Fittings 

Limited (ﬁthe Companyﬂ) as at March 31, 2021 in conjunction with 

our audit of the Ind AS financial statements of the Company for 

the year ended on that date. 
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to Ind AS 

financial statements and such internal financial controls over 

financial reporting were operating effectively as at March 31, 

2021, based on the internal financial controls with reference to 

Ind AS financial statements criteria established by the Company 

considering the essential components of internal control stated 

in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 

Financial Reporting issued by the ICAI 
Management™s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls

The Company™s management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial 

controls based on the internal control over financial reporting 

criteria established by the Company considering the essential 

components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on 

Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting 

issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountant of India (ﬁICAIﬂ). 

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and 

maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were 

operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient 

conduct of its business, including adherence to the Company™s 

policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and 

detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness 

of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable 

financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013 

(ﬁthe Actﬂ).
Auditors™ Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company™s 
internal financial controls with reference to Ind AS financial 

Statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in 

accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial 

Controls over Financial Reporting (ﬁthe Guidance Noteﬂ) and 

the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under section 143(10) of 

the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial 

controls with reference to Ind AS financial statements. Those 

Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with 

ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 

reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial 

controls with reference to Ind AS financial Statements were 

established and maintained and whether such controls operated 

effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence 

about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system with 

reference to Ind AS financial statements and their operating 

effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with 

reference to Ind AS financial statements included obtaining an 

understanding of such internal financial controls, assessing the 

risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating 

the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based 

on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the 

auditor™s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of 

material misstatement of the Ind AS financial statements, whether 

due to fraud or error.

 

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 

and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the 

Company™s internal financial controls with reference to Ind AS 

financial statements. 
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Ind AS 
financial statements
A Company™s internal financial control with reference to Ind AS 
financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable 

assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the 

preparation of Ind AS financial statements for external purposes 

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A 

Company™s internal financial control with reference to Ind AS 

financial statements include those policies and procedures that:
(a)
 
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable 
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 

dispositions of the assets of the Company;
(b)
 
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are 

recorded as necessary to permit preparation of Ind AS 

financial statements in accordance with generally accepted 

accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures 

of the Company are being made only in accordance 

with authorisations of management and directors of the 

Company; and
(c )
 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention 

or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or 

disposition of the Company™s assets that could have a 

material effect on the Ind AS financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference 

to Ind AS financial statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial with 
reference to Ind AS financial statements, including the possibility 

of collusion or improper management override of controls, 

material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not 
Annexure B to the Independent Auditors™ Report of even date on the Ind AS
financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2021
103
be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to Ind AS financial statements to future 
periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to Ind AS financial statements may become inadequate 

because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Significant Accounting Policies:
      

      
 (a )
 
Statement of Compliance:
       

    
 
The financial statements of the Company are prepared in 

accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) 

notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 

Rules, 2015 as amended by the Companies (Indian 

Accounting Standards) (Amendment) Rules, 2016, the 

relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 (ﬁthe Act™™).
 
The financial statements are authorized for issue by the 

Board of Directors of the Company at their meeting held on 

May 12, 2021
          

 
(b)
 
Basis of Preparation and Presentation:
     

      
 
Basis of Preparation:
        
   
 
The financial statements have been prepared on the 

historical cost basis except for  following assets and 

liabilities:
(i)   
 
Derivative Financial Instruments measured at fair 
value.
(ii) 
 
Certain financial assets and liabilities measured at 

fair value (refer accounting policy regarding financial 

instruments).
(iii)
 
Employee™s Defined Benefit Plan as per actuarial 

valuation.
 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an 

asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 

between market participants at the measurement date, 

regardless of whether that price is directly observable or 

estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating 

the fair value of an asset or liability, the Company takes into 
account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market 

participants would take those characteristic into account 

when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
 

 
Functional and Presentation Currency:
 
The financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees, 

which is the functional currency of the Company and 

currency of primary economic environment in which 

company operates. All amounts disclosed in financial 

statements which also include the accompanying notes have 

been rounded off to nearest rupee as per the requirement of 

Schedule III to the Companies Act 2013, unless otherwise 

stated.
           

 
Operating Cycle :
         
  
 
The Company has ascertained its operating cycle as 

twelve months for the purpose of Current / Non-Current 

classification of its Assets and Liabilities.
  
 
(c )
 
Property, plant and equipment (PPE) :
    
 
      
 
The initial cost of PPE comprises its purchase price, 
including import duties and non-refundable purchase 

taxes, and any directly attributable costs of bringing 

an asset to working condition and location for its 

intended use, including relevant borrowing costs and 

any expected costs of decommissioning. Subsequent 

expenditures related to an item of Property, plant and 

equipment are added to its book value only if they 

meet the definition of PPE as specified in Ind AS 16 Œ 

Property, Plant and Equipment.
 
Expenditure/ Income during construction period 

(including financing cost related to borrowed funds 

for construction or acquisition of qualifying PPE) is 

included under Capital Work-in-Progress, and the same 

is allocated to the respective PPE on the completion of 

their construction.  Advances given towards acquisition 

or construction of PPE outstanding at each reporting 

date are disclosed as Capital Advances under ﬁOther 

non-current Assetsﬂ.
 
Material items such as spare parts, stand-by equipment 

and service equipment are classified as PPE when they 

meet the definition of PPE as specified in Ind AS 16 Œ 

Property, Plant and Equipment.
 
If significant part of an item of PPE have different useful 

life, then they are accounted for as separate items of 

PPE.
 
Company Overview and Significant Accounting Policies

(d)
 
Depreciation:
          
 
 
Depreciable amount for PPE is the cost of an PPE less its 

estimated residual value. Depreciation on PPE are charged 

based on straight line method on an estimated useful life as 

prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 or as 

per technical assessment.

(e)
 
Intangible assets :
         

  
 
Intangible assets acquired separately
     
      
 
Intangible assets that are acquired separately with finite 

useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation 

and accumulated impairment, if any. The Company 
determines the amortisation period as the period over which 
the future economic benefits will flow to the Company after 
taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances. The 
estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed 
periodically, with the effect of any changes in estimate being 
accounted for on a prospective basis. Intangible assets with 

indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are tested for 

impairment annually, either individually or at the cash-
generating unit level.
   
 
Derecognition of intangible assets
      
     
 
An intangible asset is derecognized on disposal, or when no 

future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. 

Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible 

asset are recognized in the statement of profit and loss 

when the asset is derecognized.
 

 
Internally generated Intangible assets (Research and 

Development expenditure)
       

   
 
 
 
Expenditure pertaining to research is expensed as incurred. 

Expenditure incurred on development is capitalised if such 

expenditure leads to creation of an asset, otherwise such 

expenditure is charged to the Statement of Profit and 

Loss.
 
 
Useful lives of intangible assets are as under:

3 to 10 years
           
(f)
 
Impairment of Non-Financial Assets :
     
      

 
At the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews 

the carrying amounts of non-financial assets to determine 

whether there is any indication that those assets have 

suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, 

the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to 

determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). When 

it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an 

individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable 

amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 

When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be 

identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual 

cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to 

the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a 

reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.
 
 

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less 

costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value 

in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted 
Notes to the Financial Statements
 
For The Year Ended 31
st
 March, 2021
113
to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value 

of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the 

estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
 
 

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) 

is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 

amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to 

its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised 

immediately in Statement of Profit and Loss, unless the 

relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case 

the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
 
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the 

carrying amount of the asset (or a cash-generating unit) is 

increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, 

but to the extent that the increased carrying amount does 

not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 

determined had no impairment loss been recognised for 

the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal 

of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the 

Statement of Profit and Loss, unless the relevant asset is 

carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of 

the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
 
(g)
 
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held 

for disposal :
 
Non-current assets are classified as held for disposal if their 

carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale 

transaction rather than through continuing use.  Such assets 

are measured at lower of their carrying amount and fair 

value less costs to sell To classify any  asset as  ﬁAsset held 

for disposalﬂ the asset must be available for immediate sale 

in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual 

and customary for sales of such assets and its sale is highly 

probable. Also, Management must be committed to the sale, 

which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a 

completed sale within a year from the date of classification. 

Once classified as held for disposal, intangible assets and 

PPE are no longer amortised or depreciated.
           
(h)
 
Inventories :
          
 
 
Raw materials, fuel, stores & spare parts and packing 
materials:
 
Valued at lower of cost and net realisable value (NRV). 
However, these items are considered to be realisable at 
cost, if the finished products, in which they will be used, 
are expected to be sold at or above cost. Cost is determined 
on first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis. The cost of inventory 

comprises its purchase price, including non-refundable 

purchase taxes, and any directly attributable costs related 
to the inventories.
 
Work-in- progress (WIP), finished goods, stock-in-trade 
and trial run inventories:
 
Valued at lower of cost and NRV. Cost of Finished goods 

and WIP includes cost of raw materials, direct labour, other 

direct costs and related production overheads upto the 

relevant stage of completion.
           
 
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 

course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and 

the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
 
(i)
 
Employee Benefits :
         

  
 
Employee benefits include Gratuity, Provident Fund, 

Employee Family Pension, Employee State Insurance 

Scheme and Compensated Absences.
    
 

 
Defined benefit plans:
           

 
For defined benefit plans, the cost of providing benefits is 

determined using the projected unit credit method, with 

actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each 

annual reporting period. Re-measurement, comprising 

actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the changes to the 

asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on plan assets 

(excluding net interest), is reflected immediately in the 

Balance Sheet with a charge or credit recognised in Other 

Comprehensive Income (OCI) in the period in which they 

occur. Re-measurement recognised in OCI is reflected 

immediately in retained earnings and will not be reclassified 

to Statement of Profit and Loss. Past service cost is 

recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period 

of a plan amendment. Net interest is calculated by applying 

the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net 

defined benefit liability or asset. Defined benefit costs are 

categorised as follows:
(i)   
 
service cost (including current service cost, past service 
cost, as well as gains and losses on curtailments and 

settlements);
(ii)  
 
net interest expense or income; and
(iii) 
 
re-measurement
 

The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is 

calculated using a discount rate which is determined by 

reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period 

on government bonds.
 
The defined benefit obligation recognised in the Balance 

Sheet represents the actual deficit or surplus in the 
Notes to the Financial Statements
 
For The Year Ended 31
st
 March, 2021
114
Company™s defined benefit plans. Any surplus resulting 
from this calculation is limited to the present value of any 

economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the 

plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans.
  
         
 
Defined Contribution Plan:
       

    

 
The Company™s contribution to Provident Fund and  Pension 

Fund is considered as defined contribution plans and are 

charged as an expense based on the amount of contribution 

required to be made and when services are rendered by the 

employees. Company has no further obligation beyond its 

contributions
            

 
Short-term employee benefits:
      

     

 
The undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits 

expected to be paid in exchange for the services rendered 

by employees are recognized during the year when the 

employees render the service. These benefits include 

compensated absences which are expected to occur within 

twelve months after the end of the period in which the 

employee renders the related service.
 
            

 
Long-term employee benefits:
      
 
    
 
Accumulated compensated absences, which are expected to 

be availed or encashed beyond 12 months from the end of 

the year are treated as other long-term employee benefits. 

The company™s liability is actuarially determined (using 

the Projected Unit Credit method) at the end of each year. 

Actuarial losses/gains are recognised in the Statement of 

Profit and Loss in the year in which they arise.
   
 
 
Employee Share based payment:
      
     
 
Equity settled share based payments to employees are 

measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the 

grant date.
 
 
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity 
settled share based payments is amortised on a straight 
line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company™s 
estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with 
a corresponding increase in equity.
 
At the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its 
estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to 
vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if 

any, is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss such 
that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, 
with a corresponding adjustment to the equity-settled 
employee benefits reserve.
(j)
 
Borrowing costs :
         
  
 
Borrowing cost (General and Specific) includes interest, 
amortization of ancillary costs incurred in connection with 

the arrangement of borrowings and exchange differences 

arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent 

they are regarded as an adjustment to the interest cost.  

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 

construction or production of qualifying assets, which 

are assets that necessarily takes a substantial period of 

time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added 

to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets 

are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
 
Interest income earned on the temporary investment of 

specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying 

assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for 

capitalization.
 
All other borrowing costs are recognized in the statement of 

profit and loss in the period in which they are incurred.
  
 
(k)
 
Foreign Currencies :
         
  

 
In preparing the financial statements of the Company, 

transactions in currencies other than the Company™s 

functional currency (i.e. foreign currencies) are recognised 

at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the 

transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary 

items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at 

the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items carried 

at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are 

translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value 

was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in 

terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated 

using the exchange rate as at the date of initial transactions.
 
 

Exchange differences on monetary items are recognised in 

the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they 

arise except for, exchange differences on foreign currency 

borrowings relating to assets under construction for future 

productive use, which are included in the cost of those 

assets when they are regarded as an adjustment to interest 

costs on those foreign currency borrowings.
(l)
 
Revenue Recognition  :
       
a 
 
Revenue from operations
        
  
 
Revenue is recognized on the basis of approved contracts 
regarding the transfer of goods or services to a customer 

for an amount that reflects the consideration to which 
the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those 
goods or services. Revenue is measured at the fair value 
Notes to the Financial Statements
 
For The Year Ended 31
st
 March, 2021
115
of consideration received or receivable taking into account 
the amount of discounts, rebates, outgoing taxes on sales of 

goods or services.
 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration 

received or receivable for the goods supplied and services 

rendered, net of returns, discounts and incentives to 

customers. Revenue excludes amount collected on behalf 

of third parties viz. Goods and Service Tax (GST).
 
 
Revenue from contract with customer are recognised when 

goods are dispatched and the control over the goods sold 

are transferred to customers.
 
Revenue from turnkey contracts having performance 

obligation to be fulfilled over the time are recognised 

measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of 

that performance obligation. The Company measures the 

progress using the Output method.
 
 
Costs to fulfill a contract which is directly related to a 
contract or to an anticipated contract, generates or enhance 
resources of the Company that will be used in satisfying 
performance obligations in the future and expected to be 
recovered are recognised as an Asset
           

 
Variable consideration includes discounts and incentives 
provided to the customers. It is estimated at contract 
inception considering the terms of contract with customers 
and constrained until it is highly probable that a significant 
revenue reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue 
recognised will not occur when the associated uncertainty 
with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. It 
is reassessed at end of each reporting
 
The Company does not expect to have any contracts where 
the period between the transfer of goods and payment by 

customer exceeds one year. Hence, the Company does not 

adjust revenue for the time value of money.
    
 
 
Other Income
          
 

(i)    
 
Dividend Income is accounted for when the right to 

receive the income is established.
(ii)   
 
Interest income is recognized on time proportion 

basis taking into account the amount outstanding on 

effective interest rate.
(iii) 
 
Difference between the sale price and carrying value 

of investment is recognised as profit or loss on sale / 

redemption on investment on trade date of transaction.
(m) 
 
Government Grant
 

 
Government Grants, related to assets, are recognised in the 

Statement of Profit and Loss on a systematic basis over the 

periods in which the Company recognises the related costs 

for which the grants are intended to compensate. 
 
Government grants related to income are recognised in the 

Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they 

become receivable.
 
Government grants are not recognised until there is 

reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with 

the conditions attached to them  and that the grants will be 

received.
(n)
 
Lease:
          
 
           
 
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) has vide notification 
dated March 30, 2019 has mandated applicability of Ind AS 
116 (Leases) from April 1, 2019.
n.1 
 
The Company as a Lessee:
 
The Company, at the inception of a contract, assesses 
whether the contract is a lease or not lease. A contract 
is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to 
control the use of an identified asset for a time in exchange 
for a consideration. This policy has been applied to contracts 
existing and entered into on or after April 1, 2019.
 
The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease 
liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use 
asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the 
initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease 
payments made at or before the commencement date, plus 
any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to 
dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the 
underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any 
lease incentives received. 
 
The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the 

straight-line method from the commencement date to the 

end of the lease term. The right-of-use asset is periodically 

reviewed for impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for 

certain re-measurements of the lease liability.
 
The lease liability is initially measured at the present 

value of the lease payments that are not paid at the 

commencement date, discounted using the the Company™s 

incremental borrowing rate.  Lease payments included in the 

measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:
Notes to the Financial Statements
 
For The Year Ended 31
st
 March, 2021
116
 
Œ
 
fixed payments, including in-substance fixed 
payments;
 
Œ
 
variable lease payments that depend on an index or a 

rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the 

commencement date;
 
 
Œ
 
amounts expected to be payable under a residual value 

guarantee; and
 
 
Œ
 
the exercise price under a purchase option that the 

company is reasonably certain to exercise,  lease 

payments in an optional renewal period if the company 

is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, 

and penalties for early termination of a lease unless 

the company is reasonably certain not to terminate 

early
 
I
t is remeasured when there is a change in future lease 
payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is 

a change in the Company™s estimate of the amount expected 

to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if the 

Company changes its assessment of whether it will exercise 

a purchase, extension or termination option. When the lease 

liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment 

is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is 

recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-

use asset has been reduced to zero.
 
          

n.2 
 
Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
           

 
The Company has chosen not to recognise right-of-use 

assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have 

a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value 

assets. The Company recognises the lease payments 

associated with these leases as an expense over the lease 

term.
           
      
(o)
 
Income Taxes:
          
 
 
Tax expense represents the sum of the current tax and 
deferred tax.
          
 
 
Current Tax
 
          
 
 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the 

year. Current tax is measured at the amount expected to be 

paid to the tax authorities, based on estimated tax liability 
computed after taking credit for allowances and exemption 
in accordance with the local tax laws. The Company™s current 
tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
 
Deferred tax 
          
 
 
Deferred tax is provided, on all temporary differences at the 

reporting date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 

and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax 

rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary 

differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have 

been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. 

Tax relating to items recognised directly in equity or OCI is 

recognised in equity or OCI and not in the Statement Profit 

and Loss.
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a 

legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and 

assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same 

tax authority.
 
A deferred tax asset is recognized to the extent that it is 

probable that future taxable profits will be available against 

which the temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax 

assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced 

to the extent that it is no longer probable.
(p)
 
Earnings per share :
         
  

 
A basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the 

profit/(loss) after tax for the year attributable to equity 

shareholders by the weighted average number of equity 

shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per 

share is computed by dividing the profit/(loss) after tax  

for the year attributable to equity shareholders by the 

weighted average number of equity shares considered for 

deriving basic earnings per share and the weighted average 

number of equity shares which could have been issued 

on the conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.
 
Potential equity shares are deemed to be dilutive only 

if their conversion to equity shares would decrease the 

net profit per share from continuing ordinary operations. 

Potential dilutive equity shares are deemed to be converted 

as at the beginning of the period, unless they have been 

issued at a later date. The dilutive potential equity shares 

are adjusted for the proceeds receivable had the shares 

been actually issued at fair value (i.e. average market value 

of the outstanding shares). Dilutive potential equity shares 

are determined independently for each period presented.
           

(q)
 
Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets 
and Commitments :
 
        
  
 
Provisions are recognized when the Company has a 
present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result 
Notes to the Financial Statements
 
For The Year Ended 31
st
 March, 2021
117
of a past event, it is probable that the Company will 
be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable 

estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
 
The amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate 

of the consideration required to settle the present obligation 

at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the 

risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligations. When 

a provision is measured using the cash flow estimated to 

settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the 

present obligations of those cash flows (when the effect of 

the time value of money is material). When some or all of the 

economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected 

to be recovered from a third party, a receivable is recognized 

as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be 

received and the amount of the receivable can be measured 

reliably. Contingent liabilities and Contingent assets are not 

recognized in the financial statements.
           

 
Contingent assets are not recognised in financial statements 

since this may result in the recognition of income that may 

never be realised. However, when the realisation of income is 

virtually certain, then the related asset is not a contingent asset 

and is recognised. A contingent asset is disclosed, in financial 

statements, where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.
(r )
 
Financial Instruments:
        

   
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when 

a Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 

the instruments.
         
  
 
Initial Recognition
         
  

 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured 

at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable 

to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial 

liabilities (other than  financial assets and financial liabilities 

at fair value through profit or loss and ancillary costs related 

to borrowings) are added to or deducted from the fair value 

of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, 

on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable 

to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at 

fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately 

in Statement of Profit and Loss.
 
          

 
Classification and Subsequent Measurement: Financial 

Assets
           

 
The Company classifies financial assets as subsequently 

measured at amortised cost, fair value through other 

comprehensive income (ﬁFVOCIﬂ) or fair value through profit 

or loss (ﬁFVTPLﬂ) on the basis of following:
(i)  
 
the entity™s business model for managing the financial 
assets and
(ii) 
 
the contractual cash flow characteristics of the 
financial asset.
 
Amortised Cost
         
 
 
 
A financial asset shall be classified and measured at 

amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met:
(i)  
 
the financial asset is held within a business model 
whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to 
collect contractual cash flows and
(ii) 
 
the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on 
specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments 

of principal and interest on the principal amount 

outstanding.
 
In case of financial asset classified and measured at 

amortised cost, any interest income, foreign exchange gains/

losses and impairment are recognised in the Statement of 

Profit and Loss.
        
 
 
Fair Value through OCI
        

   
 
A financial asset shall be classified and measured at fair 

value through OCI if both of the following conditions are 

met:
(i)  
 
the financial asset is held within a business model 
whose objective is achieved by both collecting 
contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and
(ii) 
 
the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on 
specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments 

of principal and interest on the principal amount 

outstanding.
 
Where the Company has elected to present the fair value 

gain on equity instruments in other comprehensive income, 

there is no subsequent classification of fair value gain 

or losses to profit and loss account. Dividend from such 

instruments is recognized in profit and loss account as other 

income where right to receive is established.
    
       
 
Fair Value through Profit or Loss
      
     
 
A financial asset shall be classified and measured at 

fair value through profit or loss unless it is measured at 

amortised cost or at fair value through OCI. All recognised 

financial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety

at either amortised cost or fair value, depending on the 
classification of the financial assets. For financial assets at 

fair value through profit or loss, net gain or losses, including 

any interest or dividend income are recognised in the 

Statement of Profit and Loss.
       
    
 
Classification and Subsequent Measurement: Financial 

liabilities
           

 
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities 

at FVTPL or ‚other financial liabilities™.
           

 
Financial Liabilities at FVTPL
       
    
 
Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL when the 

financial liability is held for trading or are designated upon 

initial recognition as FVTPL. Gains or Losses on liabilities 

held for trading are recognised in the Statement of Profit 

and Loss.
 
 
Other Financial Liabilities
       
 
   
 
Other financial liabilities (including borrowings and trade and 

other payables) are subsequently measured at amortised 

cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense 

(based on effective interest method), foreign exchange 

gains and losses and any gain or loss on derecognition is 

recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
           

 
Impairment of financial assets
       
    
 
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for 

indicators of impairment at the end of each reporting period. 

The Company recognises a loss allowance for expected 

credit losses on financial asset. In case of trade receivables, 

the Company follows the simplified approach permitted 

by Ind AS 109 Œ Financial Instruments for recognition of 

impairment loss allowance. The application of simplified 

approach does not require the Company to track changes 

in credit risk. The Company calculates the expected credit 

losses on trade receivables using a provision matrix on the 

basis of its historical credit loss experience.
   
 
 
Derecognition of financial assets
      

     
 
The Company derecognises a financial asset when the 

contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or 

when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the 

risks and rewards of the asset or if, the Company has neither 

transferred nor retained substantially all risk and reward of 

the asset, but has transferred control of the asset to another 

party. 
 
On derecognition of a financial asset, other than investments 

classified as FVOCI, in its entirety, the difference between the 

asset™s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration 

received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that 

had been recognised in other comprehensive income and 

accumulated in equity is recognised in profit or loss if such 

gain or loss would have otherwise been recognised in profit 

or loss on disposal of that financial asset.
 
On derecognition of equity investments classified as FVOCI, 

accumulated gains or loss recognised in OCI is transferred 

to retained earnings.
         
  
 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments:
    

       
 
(i) 
 
Classification as debt or equity 
 
Debt and equity instruments issued by the Company 

are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity 

in accordance with the substance of the contractual 

arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability 

and an equity instrument.
 
(ii) 
 
Equity instruments
 
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences 

a residual interest in the assets of an entity after 

deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued 

by a Company are recognised at the proceeds received.
 
         
(s)
 
Cash and cash equivalents :
       

    
 
Cash and cash equivalents in the Balance Sheet comprise 

cash at bank, Cheques and Cash in hand and short-term 

deposits with banks that are readily convertible into cash 

which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value 

and are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash 

commitments.
           

(t)
 
Derivative financial instruments :
      
     
 
The Company enters into derivative financial instruments viz. 
foreign exchange forward contracts and cross currency swaps 

to manage its exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange 

rate risks and commodity prices. The Company does not hold 

derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the 

derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently 

remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting 

period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or 

loss immediately excluding derivatives designated as cash 

flow hedge. 
          
 
Notes to the Financial Statements
 
For The Year Ended 31
st
 March, 2021
119
(u)
 
Hedge accounting:
         
  
 
The Company designates certain hedging instruments in 

respect of foreign currency risk and interest rate risk price 

risk as cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge 

relationship, the entity documents the relationship between 

the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its 

risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking 

various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of 

the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Company documents 

whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in 

offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged 

item attributable to the hedged risk.
      
     
 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the 

designated portion of derivatives that qualify as cash flow 

hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income and 

accumulated under equity. The gain or loss relating to the 

ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
 
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive 

income and accumulated in equity relating to effective 

portion as described above are reclassified to profit or loss 

in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss, in 

the same line as the recognised hedged item. However, when 

the hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of 

a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, such gains 

and losses are transferred from equity and included in the 

initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or 

non-financial liability.
        
   
 
Hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when 

the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or 

exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. 

Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income 

and accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity and 

is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately 

recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is 

no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in 

equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
(v)
 
Cash Flow Statement:
        

   
 
Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby 

the net profit before tax is adjusted for the effects of 

transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals 

of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and item 

of income or expenses associated with investing or financing 

cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and 

financing activities of the Company are segregated.
(w)
 
Segment Reporting:
         

  
 
Operating segments are defined as components of an 

enterprise for which discrete financial information is 

available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating 

decision maker, in deciding how to allocate resources and 

assessing performance.
3. 
 
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of 

estimation uncertainty 
        
    
 
The preparation of the Company™s financial statements 
requires management to make judgements, estimates and 

assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, 

expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying 

disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. 

Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could 

result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the 

carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future 

periods.
 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
     
      

 
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key 

sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that 

have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to 

the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the 

next financial year, are described below. The Company 

based its assumptions and estimates on parameters 

available when the financial statements were prepared. 

Existing circumstances and assumptions about future 

developments, however, may change due to market changes 

or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the 

Company. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions 

when they occur.
(i) 
 
Useful lives of property, plant and equipment :
   
        
 
The Company uses its technical expertise along with 
historical and industry trends for determining the economic 
life of an asset/component of an asset. The useful lives 
are reviewed by management periodically and revised, 
if appropriate. In case of a revision, the unamortised 
depreciable amount is charged over the remaining useful 
life of the assets.
(ii) 
 
Defined benefit obligation :
      
 
    
 
The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and the 
present value of the gratuity obligation are determined 
Notes to the Financial Statements
 
For The Year Ended 31
st
 March, 2021
120
using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves 
making various assumptions that may differ from actual 

developments in the future. These include the determination 

of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality 

rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and 

its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly 

sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions 

are reviewed at each reporting date.
 
          

(iii) 
 
Fair value measurement of Financial Instruments :
   
        
 
When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities 
recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on 

quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured 

using valuation techniques including the Discounted Cash 

Flow model. The inputs to these models are taken from 

observable markets where possible, but where this is not 

feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing 

fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs 

such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility.
 
(iv) 
 
Income taxes :
         
 
 
 
Significant judgements are involved in estimating budgeted 
profits for the purpose of paying advance tax, determining 

the provision for income taxes, including amount expected 

to be paid/recovered for uncertain tax positions.
           

(v) 
 
Revenue from turnkey project :
     
 
     
 
The Company has recognised revenue and cost from this 

project. Due to the nature of the project, recognition of 

revenue and cost involves usage of percentage of completion 

method which is determined based on the progress towards 

complete satisfaction of that performance obligation, which 
involves significant judgments, identification of contractual 

obligations and the Company™s rights to receive payments 

for performance completed till date.
 
 

(vi) 
 
Leases :
 
The Company considers all the extension-options under the 

commercial contract for determining the lease-term which 

forms the basis for the measurement of right-of-use asset 

and the corresponding lease-liability.
     
      
(vii) 
 
Share-based payments :
        
   
 
The Company measures the cost of equity-settled 
transactions with employees using Black-Scholes model 
to determine the fair value of the liability incurred on the 
grant date. Estimating fair value for share-based payment 
transactions requires determination of the most appropriate 
valuation model, which is dependent on the terms and 
conditions of the grant.  This estimate also requires 
determination of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation 
model including the expected life of the share option, 
volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about 
them. The assumptions and models used for estimating fair 
value for share-based payment transactions are disclosed 
in Note 37.
          
 
(viii) 
 
Discount, Incentives & Rebates :
     
 
     
 
Revenue is measured net of discounts, incentives, rebates 
etc. given to the customers on the Company™s sales. The 

Company™s presence across different marketing regions 

within the country and the competitive business environment 

makes the assessment of various type of discounts, 

incentives and rebates as complex and judgmental.

A. 
 
Market Risk
 
         
 
Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash flows that may result from a change in the price 

of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign 

currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. 

Market risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including investments and deposits, foreign currency 

receivables, payables and borrowings.
 
                

1) 
 
Foreign Currency risk
          

 
Foreign currency risk is the risk of impact related to fair value or future cash flows of an exposure in foreign currency, which 

fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company™s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange 

rates relates primarily to import of raw materials, capital expenditure and exports. When a derivative is entered for the 

purpose of being a hedge, the Company negotiates the terms of those derivatives to match the terms of the hedged exposure.
 
The Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from foreign currency transactions. The Company follows established 

risk management policies and procedures. It uses derivative instruments like foreign currency forwards and cross currency 

swaps to hedge exposure to foreign currency risk.

Interest Rate Risk
         
 

 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash 

flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of 

changes in market interest rates. The company™s exposure to 
the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily 
to the company™s term loans and short term borrowing with 
floating interest rate. For foreign currency loan with floating 
rate, the risk of variation in interest rate is mitigated through 
cross currency swap. The company constantly monitors the 

credit markets and rebalances its financing strategies to 
achieve an optimal maturity profile and financing cost.

 Commodity Price Risk
          

 
Commodity price risk for the Company is mainly related to fluctuations in raw material prices linked to various external factors, 

which can affect the production cost of the Company. To manage this risk, the Company monitors factors affecting prices, identifies 

new sources of supply of raw material, monitors inventory level, etc.
             
    
B. 
 
Credit Risk Management
 
         
 
Credit risk arises when a customer or counterparty does not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, 
leading to a financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and 
from its financing / investing activities, including deposits with banks, foreign exchange transactions and financial guarantees. 
The Company has no significant concentration of credit risk with any counterparty.

Trade Receivable
         
 
 
Trade receivables are consisting of a large number of 
customers / distributors. The Company has credit evaluation 
policy for each customer / distributor and based on the 

evaluation credit limit of each customer / distributor is 

defined.
 
         
 
Total trade receivable as on March 31, 2021 Rs. 3,533.71 
million (March 31, 2020 is Rs. 1,797.08 million.)
   

       
 
As per simplified approach, the Company makes provision of 

expected credit losses on trade receivables using a provision 

matrix to mitigate the risk of default payments and makes 

appropriate provision at each reporting date wherever 

outstanding is for longer period and involves higher risk. 

The policy for creating provision for credit losses on trade 

receivables is as per following provision matrix:-
Particular 
Loss 
Allowance 
Provision
0 to year
Nil
Above one year and less than two year
20%
Above two year and less than three year
40%
Above three year and less than four year
80%
More than four year 
100%
    
Further, in addition to the provisions as per provision matrix, 

the Company also provides for credit allowances on specific 

identification basis.

Investments, Derivative Instruments, Cash and Cash

Credit Risk on cash and cash equivalent, deposits with 

the banks / financial institutions is generally low as the 
said deposits have been made with the banks / financial 
institutions who have been assigned high credit rating by 
international and domestic rating agencies.
    
          
 
Credit Risk on Derivative Instruments are generally low 
as Company enters into the Derivative Contracts with the 
reputed Banks and Financial Institutions.
     
     
C. 
 
Liquidity Risk
 
        
 
 
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company will 
not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at 

reasonable price. Prudent liquidity risk management implies 

maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities and 

the availability of funding through an adequate amount of 

credit facilities to meet obligations when due. In addition, 

processes and policies related to such risks are overseen by 

senior management. Management monitors the Company™s 

liquidity position through rolling forecasts on the basis of 

expected cash flows.
        
The table below provides details regarding the remaining contractual maturities of financial liabilities and investments held for 

managing the risk at the reporting date based on contractual undiscounted payments.

Fair Value measurements (Ind AS 113)
          
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are 

included at the amount at which the instrument could be 

exchanged in an orderly transaction in the principal (or 

most advantageous) market at measurement date under 

the current market condition regardless of whether that 

price is directly observable or estimated using other 

valuation techniques. The Company has established 

the following fair value hierarchy that categorises the 

values into 3 levels. The inputs to valuation techniques 

used to measure fair value of financial instruments are:
 
 
 
Level 1: This hierarchy uses quoted (unadjusted) prices 

in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The fair 

value of all quoted investments which are traded in the 
stock exchanges is valued using the closing price or dealer 
quotations as at the reporting date.
 
 
Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that 
are not traded in an active market is determined using 
valuation techniques which maximize the use of 
observable market data and rely as little as possible 
on company specific estimates. Unquoted investments 
are valued using the closing Net Asset Value. If all 
significant inputs required to fair value an instrument 
are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2. 
 
 
Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based 

on observable market data, the instrument is included in 
Level 3.

The management assessed that cash and bank balances, 
trade receivables, trade payables, cash credits and other 
financial assets and liabilities approximate their carrying 
amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these 
instruments.
          
The following methods and assumptions were used to 
estimate the fair values:
(a) 
 
The fair values of the quoted investments are based on 
market price/net asset value at the reporting date. 
(b) 
 
The fair value of unquoted investments is based on 

closing Net Assets Value.
(
C
)
 
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts 
is calculated as the present value determined using 
forward exchange rates and interest rate curve of the 
respective currencies.
(d) 
 
The fair value of currency swap is calculated as the 
present value determined using forward exchange 
rates, currency basis spreads between the respective 
currencies, interest rate curves and an appropriate 
discount factor.
(e) 
 
The fair value of the remaining financial instruments 
is determined using discounted cash flow analysis. 
The discount rates used is based on management 
estimates.

of the fund during the estimated term of the obligations.

 Asset Liability matching strategy: 
  
           

 
The money contributed by the Company to the Gratuity fund to finance the liabilities of the plan has to be invested for funded 

gratuity plan. The Company has outsourced the investment management of the fund to an Insurance Company. The Insurance 

Company in turn manages these funds as per the permissible limits prescribed in the insurance regulation. Due to the restriction 

in the type of investment that can be held by the fund,it is not possible to explicitly follow an asset libility matching strategy. 

There is no compulsion on the part of the Company to fully prefund the liability of the Plan.
         
    
xiv)
 
The Company™s expected contribution during next year is Rs. 32.05 million (March 31, 2020 of Rs. 32.99 million).
