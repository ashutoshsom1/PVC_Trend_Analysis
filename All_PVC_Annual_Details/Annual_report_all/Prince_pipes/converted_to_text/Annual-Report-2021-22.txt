A SMALL STEP BY PRINCE PIPES,
A BIG LEAP FOR MANDVI
Dear Shareholders,
I write to you at a time when the worst of the pandemic seems 
to be behind us, even though spurts in COVID-19 cases 
continue emerging, which gives us reason to continue to follow 
hygiene protocol and practise caution.
After a 3.5% contraction in 2020, the world™s real GDP 
rebounded at an estimated 5.6% in 2021, reaching a new high 

in the first quarter. The Indian economy too, overcame the 

pandemic™s headwinds. The improved economic performance 

was the result of rapid vaccinations, relaxation in curbs caused 
by the pandemic, massive fiscal support, revival of consumer 
spending and improved business activity. India™s GDP is 

estimated to have expanded 8.7% in FY 2021-22 against a 

contraction of 6.6% in FY 2020-21.
As we worked through FY 2021-22, Passion, Purpose and 
Progress Œ are the 3 core principles that steered our 

momentum and guided Prince Pipes in maintaining its firm 

vision on long-term value creation.  
An unstoppable spirit, resilience and growth continued to 
underline FY2022
 
On an annual basis, we were able to maintain an EBITDA 
expansion of 15% with margins at 15.6%, driven by our 

cost efficiency measures, operational aggression, 
competent supply chain management and strong 
marketing thrust. The Company concentrated on 

building on the business fundamentals and continued 

to implement key strategic initiatives that were 

undertaken in the earlier fiscal which gave us the 

edge and agility to leverage the uptake in economic 

activity, ensure quick on-ground execution, 

accelerate business progress, continue innovation, 

and deliver growth. 
I am proud to share that Prince Pipes is now a 
Fortune India 500 company,
 as announced in 
December 2021. The Fortune India 500 

rankings list companies across 

India that have continued to 

report growth and expansion 

by revenues, despite the 

pandemic headwinds. On 

behalf of all my colleagues, 

I thank each you for your 

continued support and 
dedication as we 
strengthen our foothold 

as a brand amongst 

brands and expand 

market share.
Building upon strong 
fundamentals
Through FY 2021-22, 
we continued to 

implement our 

strategy of adding 

greater capacities, 

expanding our 
network, premiumizing our brand, and optimising our product 

mix towards high value-added margin products. The Company 

reported consolidated revenue growth by 28% to Rs. 2,657 

crores, EBITDA grew by 15% to Rs. 415 crore and EBIDTA 

margins stood at 15.6% in FY22. Profit after tax increased by 12 
% to reach Rs 249 crore in FY22. The Company remains long 
term debt free during the year.  The Company has achieved a 

CRISIL re-rating on long-term and short-term debt with long 

term debt now rated CRISIL A+/Stable (Upgraded from CRISIL 

A/Positive) and short term CRISIL A1+ (Upgraded from CRISIL 

A1). The Board of Directors also recommended a final dividend 

of 
˜
 2 per equity share of Rs 10/- each for the year ended 31st 
March 2022.
Exciting prospects for pipes and fittings industry

These are exciting times for the Indian economy which has 
already taken centre stage at the global level. Strengthening 
water infrastructure and transportation has emerged as one of 
the key missions of the Central Government.  The Union Budget 

2022-23 had outlined initiatives to maintain and stimulate this 

momentum with INR480bn being allotted for Housing projects 

under PM housing scheme, INR600 bn allocated to cover 
38mn households for tap water as part of Har Ghar, Nal Se Jal 
scheme and the continuation of the expansion of national 
highways Œ all of which augurs well for the pipes and 
fittings industry*1. National development initiatives 
launched earlier like Swachh Bharat, Jal Jeevan 
Mission, and AMRUT will continue to provide the 
much-needed impetus for companies with high 
exposure to plumbing pipes and fittings segment. 
These are all key efforts that stimulate the pipes and 
fittings industry.
Focus on implementing growth strategy and play 
out of business model 
Guided by our senior members of the Board and led 
by a passionate and energetic management team, 
Prince Pipes faced the third and the fourth 
wave of the pandemic with unity, 
resilience, and a judicious approach. 
Our 3-pronged business strategy 
played out well and continues to focus 
on organic growth, operational 
excellence, ESG aligned progress.
We can say with confidence that we 
were able to achieve our goals well, 
during the fiscal in review, and the 
journey continues, enabled by a 
buoyant demand scenario. 
However, this year was marked by 
headwinds in terms of input costs, 
which tapered our profitability. 
Through targeted cost measures, 
inventory management, and 
strategic sourcing, we were able 
to cushion the impact to the best 
possible extent.
Operationally, we covered 
significant ground. Our Jaipur 
manufacturing facility has been awarded a Gold medal in the 

8th edition of National Awards for Manufacturing 

Competitiveness (2021 organized by International Research 

Institute for Manufacturing, in strategic association with Money 

control).
Our agenda to drive value growth was successfully led by 
further opening of the economy, calibrated brand 

premiumisation, aggressive distributor network expansion, 

focused dealer engagement activities and portfolio expansion. 

We also ensured strong supply security. We expanded our 

portfolio which is already one of the largest in the industry, with 

new product launches including PE-FIT Aqua - HDPE Piping 

Systems that finds application in Potable Water City Pipe 

Network, Drip, Sprinkler and Lift Irrigation, Industrial Effluents, 

Infrastructure Projects, to name a few. CORFIT Manhole 

Chambers was launched at Plumbex India in New Delhi and 

finds use in Commercial & Municipal sewerage/drainage 

networks. Products launched earlier Storefit Water Tanks, and 

Prince Flowguard Plus Piping Systems have been steadily 
gaining ground making strong in-roads into target markets.
Domain knowledge and understanding of the pipes and fittings 
industry have allowed us to build a strong distribution network 

with deep relationships which is one of our core competitive 
strengths. We were awarded The Customer FEST Best Channel 
Loyalty Program. Prince Pipes was one of the first corporates in 

the pipes and fittings industry to have launched a loyalty 

program in November 2016 for plumbers and dealers. ‚Prince 

Udaan™ was created as a digital loyalty program ahead of its 

time, to cover all Prince channel partners and today it has 

achieved 125% growth in member participation over the last 3 

years.
Purpose driven growth through ESG goals:

Success must be viewed inclusive of both aspects of business 
progress and sustainability. Our focus on ESG has ensured 

sustainable value creation for all stakeholders. From 

procurement of raw materials, to ensuring sustainable 

manufacturing facilities & circular economy, we form very clear 

avenues where we can reduce the environmental impact, 

create social capital, and achieve cost efficiency. Our total 

carbon footprint reduced by 4.8%, renewable source of energy 

increased by 51% while our STP installed capacity in all plants 

increased from 87KLD to 205KLD to improve water recycling 

capacity.
Our commitment to build social capital by making impactful 
transformations in society, continues with full vigour and we 

implemented several noteworthy social impact programs. Our 

flagship event to commemorate World Plumbing Day in March 

2022 was a great success as we hosted the Shram Ka 

Sammaan Campaign across Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, 

Bangalore, Jaipur, Patna and New Delhi. The Prince Plumber 
Song was launched in several languages across India which 

gained large social media visibility. Prince felicitated plumbers 

for their long-standing association with the company, inspiring 

them about dignity of labour, and sensitising them on skill 

upgradation. The Company provided over 5000 loyal plumbers 
with accidental insurance policies - again an industry first. In 
another first, Prince Pipes donated STOREFIT water tanks of 

500 litres capacity, to villages along L.O.C. Kashmir with the 

assistance of the Indian Army aimed at bringing ease of living, 

better health and improve the quality of life in villages along the 

region. 
A future of opportunities
According to forecasts by a noted brokerage house the Indian 
pipes and fittings industry is estimated to reach Rs.550-600 

billion by FY 25, growing at a CAGR of 11-12%. This speaks for 

the industry potential and the transformation it is set to undergo 

with higher growth. Facts speak about the work that yet needs 

to be done - 600 million Indians face high to extreme stress 

over water, 75% of households do not have drinking water on 
premises and other issues of access to piped water and water

Prince Pipes and Fittings Limited
Annual Report 2021-22
Dear Shareholders,
I write to you at a time when the worst of the pandemic seems 
to be behind us, even though spurts in COVID-19 cases 
continue emerging, which gives us reason to continue to follow 
hygiene protocol and practise caution.
After a 3.5% contraction in 2020, the world™s real GDP 
rebounded at an estimated 5.6% in 2021, reaching a new high 

in the first quarter. The Indian economy too, overcame the 

pandemic™s headwinds. The improved economic performance 

was the result of rapid vaccinations, relaxation in curbs caused 
by the pandemic, massive fiscal support, revival of consumer 
spending and improved business activity. India™s GDP is 

estimated to have expanded 8.7% in FY 2021-22 against a 

contraction of 6.6% in FY 2020-21.
As we worked through FY 2021-22, Passion, Purpose and 
Progress Œ are the 3 core principles that steered our 

momentum and guided Prince Pipes in maintaining its firm 

vision on long-term value creation.  
An unstoppable spirit, resilience and growth continued to 
underline FY2022
 
On an annual basis, we were able to maintain an EBITDA 
expansion of 15% with margins at 15.6%, driven by our 

cost efficiency measures, operational aggression, 
competent supply chain management and strong 
marketing thrust. The Company concentrated on 

building on the business fundamentals and continued 

to implement key strategic initiatives that were 

undertaken in the earlier fiscal which gave us the 

edge and agility to leverage the uptake in economic 

activity, ensure quick on-ground execution, 

accelerate business progress, continue innovation, 

and deliver growth. 
I am proud to share that Prince Pipes is now a 
Fortune India 500 company,
 as announced in 
December 2021. The Fortune India 500 

rankings list companies across 

India that have continued to 

report growth and expansion 

by revenues, despite the 

pandemic headwinds. On 

behalf of all my colleagues, 

I thank each you for your 

continued support and 
dedication as we 
strengthen our foothold 

as a brand amongst 

brands and expand 

market share.
Building upon strong 
fundamentals
Through FY 2021-22, 
we continued to 

implement our 

strategy of adding 

greater capacities, 

expanding our 
network, premiumizing our brand, and optimising our product 

mix towards high value-added margin products. The Company 

reported consolidated revenue growth by 28% to Rs. 2,657 

crores, EBITDA grew by 15% to Rs. 415 crore and EBIDTA 

margins stood at 15.6% in FY22. Profit after tax increased by 12 
% to reach Rs 249 crore in FY22. The Company remains long 
term debt free during the year.  The Company has achieved a 

CRISIL re-rating on long-term and short-term debt with long 

term debt now rated CRISIL A+/Stable (Upgraded from CRISIL 

A/Positive) and short term CRISIL A1+ (Upgraded from CRISIL 

A1). The Board of Directors also recommended a final dividend 

of 
˜
 2 per equity share of Rs 10/- each for the year ended 31st 
March 2022.
Exciting prospects for pipes and fittings industry

These are exciting times for the Indian economy which has 
already taken centre stage at the global level. Strengthening 
water infrastructure and transportation has emerged as one of 
the key missions of the Central Government.  The Union Budget 

2022-23 had outlined initiatives to maintain and stimulate this 

momentum with INR480bn being allotted for Housing projects 

under PM housing scheme, INR600 bn allocated to cover 
38mn households for tap water as part of Har Ghar, Nal Se Jal 
scheme and the continuation of the expansion of national 
highways Œ all of which augurs well for the pipes and 
fittings industry*1. National development initiatives 
launched earlier like Swachh Bharat, Jal Jeevan 
Mission, and AMRUT will continue to provide the 
much-needed impetus for companies with high 
exposure to plumbing pipes and fittings segment. 
These are all key efforts that stimulate the pipes and 
fittings industry.
Focus on implementing growth strategy and play 
out of business model 
Guided by our senior members of the Board and led 
by a passionate and energetic management team, 
Prince Pipes faced the third and the fourth 
wave of the pandemic with unity, 
resilience, and a judicious approach. 
Our 3-pronged business strategy 
played out well and continues to focus 
on organic growth, operational 
excellence, ESG aligned progress.
We can say with confidence that we 
were able to achieve our goals well, 
during the fiscal in review, and the 
journey continues, enabled by a 
buoyant demand scenario. 
However, this year was marked by 
headwinds in terms of input costs, 
which tapered our profitability. 
Through targeted cost measures, 
inventory management, and 
strategic sourcing, we were able 
to cushion the impact to the best 
possible extent.
Operationally, we covered 
significant ground. Our Jaipur 
manufacturing facility has been awarded a Gold medal in the 
8th edition of National Awards for Manufacturing 

Competitiveness (2021 organized by International Research 

Institute for Manufacturing, in strategic association with Money 

control).
Our agenda to drive value growth was successfully led by 
further opening of the economy, calibrated brand 

premiumisation, aggressive distributor network expansion, 

focused dealer engagement activities and portfolio expansion. 

We also ensured strong supply security. We expanded our 

portfolio which is already one of the largest in the industry, with 

new product launches including PE-FIT Aqua - HDPE Piping 

Systems that finds application in Potable Water City Pipe 

Network, Drip, Sprinkler and Lift Irrigation, Industrial Effluents, 

Infrastructure Projects, to name a few. CORFIT Manhole 

Chambers was launched at Plumbex India in New Delhi and 

finds use in Commercial & Municipal sewerage/drainage 

networks. Products launched earlier Storefit Water Tanks, and 

Prince Flowguard Plus Piping Systems have been steadily 
gaining ground making strong in-roads into target markets.
Domain knowledge and understanding of the pipes and fittings 
industry have allowed us to build a strong distribution network 

with deep relationships which is one of our core competitive 
strengths. We were awarded The Customer FEST Best Channel 
Loyalty Program. Prince Pipes was one of the first corporates in 

the pipes and fittings industry to have launched a loyalty 

program in November 2016 for plumbers and dealers. ‚Prince 

Udaan™ was created as a digital loyalty program ahead of its 

time, to cover all Prince channel partners and today it has 

achieved 125% growth in member participation over the last 3 

years.
Purpose driven growth through ESG goals:

Success must be viewed inclusive of both aspects of business 
progress and sustainability. Our focus on ESG has ensured 

sustainable value creation for all stakeholders. From 

procurement of raw materials, to ensuring sustainable 

manufacturing facilities & circular economy, we form very clear 

avenues where we can reduce the environmental impact, 

create social capital, and achieve cost efficiency. Our total 

carbon footprint reduced by 4.8%, renewable source of energy 

increased by 51% while our STP installed capacity in all plants 

increased from 87KLD to 205KLD to improve water recycling 

capacity.
Our commitment to build social capital by making impactful 
transformations in society, continues with full vigour and we 

implemented several noteworthy social impact programs. Our 

flagship event to commemorate World Plumbing Day in March 

2022 was a great success as we hosted the Shram Ka 

Sammaan Campaign across Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, 

Bangalore, Jaipur, Patna and New Delhi. The Prince Plumber 
Song was launched in several languages across India which 

gained large social media visibility. Prince felicitated plumbers 

for their long-standing association with the company, inspiring 

them about dignity of labour, and sensitising them on skill 

upgradation. The Company provided over 5000 loyal plumbers 
with accidental insurance policies - again an industry first. In 
another first, Prince Pipes donated STOREFIT water tanks of 

500 litres capacity, to villages along L.O.C. Kashmir with the 

assistance of the Indian Army aimed at bringing ease of living, 

better health and improve the quality of life in villages along the 

region. 
A future of opportunities
According to forecasts by a noted brokerage house the Indian 
pipes and fittings industry is estimated to reach Rs.550-600 

billion by FY 25, growing at a CAGR of 11-12%. This speaks for 

the industry potential and the transformation it is set to undergo 

with higher growth. Facts speak about the work that yet needs 

to be done - 600 million Indians face high to extreme stress 

over water, 75% of households do not have drinking water on 
premises and other issues of access to piped water and water 
contamination Œ need to be addressed. The government has 

already set the ball rolling through various schemes. Several 

opportunities in the industrial realm are witnessing great 

transformation, where Prince Pipes can bring its expertise, 

knowhow, and wide product range.
As one of India™s largest integrated piping solutions & multi 
polymer manufacturers Prince Pipes continues to lead through 

a mission-oriented approach Œ playing a transformative role in 
strengthening India™s water infrastructure. This drives us 
towards creating innovations in plumbing, irrigation, storage,

Prince Pipes and Fittings Limited
Annual Report 2021-22
Global Economy
2021 had been another extraordinary year owing to the 
continuing and pervasive impact of COVID-19, especially with 
the advent of new variants that caused significant challenges. 
Supply side constraints continued to disrupt financial markets 
and businesses globally. Central banks proposed an array of 
measures to ensure credit was available to businesses and 
individuals. Large-scale vaccination drives around the world, 
together with policy measures, were steps in the right direction 
towards economic recovery. Subsequently, global economies 
entered 2022 on a weak note with the spread of the Omicron 
variant, which had much higher transmissibility, but less severity 
compared to the Delta variant.
According to the World Economic Outlook (WEO) update, the 
world economic output was reported to be 6.1% in 2021, after 
declining to 3.1% in 2020. However, the prospects of an expected 
global economic recovery seem to be more challenging since 
the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war which continues to have 
global repercussions. In April 2022, the IMF had slashed the 
global growth forecast to 3.6% for 2022 from its earlier forecast 
of 4.4%, while the growth rate for 2023 has been projected at 
3.6% (as against 3.8% earlier).
Scarring effects are expected to be much larger in emerging 
market and developing economies than in advanced economies-
reflecting limited policy support and generally slower vaccination-
with output expected to remain below the pre-pandemic trend 
throughout the forecast horizon.
The war in Ukraine has triggered a costly humanitarian crisis 
that demands peaceful resolution. Economic damage from 
the conflict will contribute to a significant slowdown in global 
growth. The conflict adds to the economic strains wrought by 
the pandemic. Although many parts of the world appear to be 
moving past the acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis, deaths 
remain high, especially among the unvaccinated.
Inflation is expected to remain elevated for longer than in the 
previous forecast, driven by war-induced commodity price 
increases and broadening price pressures. For 2022, inflation 
is projected at 5.7% in advanced economies and 8.7% in 
emerging market and developing economies-1.8% and 2.8% 
points higher than projected in January. Although a gradual 
resolution of supply-demand imbalances and a modest pickup in 
labour supply are expected in the baseline, easing price inflation 
eventually, uncertainty continues to persist. 
Outlook
The IMF™s downward revision of global growth forecasts, factor 
in a growth slowdown due to the possibility of an extension of 
sanctions to Russian energy exports along with the threat from the 
virus. Although output and investment in advanced economies 
are projected to return to pre-pandemic trends next year, they 
are most likely to remain low in emerging market and developing 
economies (EMDEs).
In addition to the war, frequent and severe lockdowns in China in 
key manufacturing hubs could lead to new bottlenecks in global 
supply chains. Higher commodity cost inflation and persistent 
price pressures could also lead to a tightening of monetary 
policy in many countries. In emerging markets and developing 
economies, the rise in food and fuel prices are critical challenges. 
The pandemic and war led disruption continue to deepen global 
supply chain challenges and inflation has become the most 
prominent concern globally. The higher interest rates regime 
points at making borrowing more expensive worldwide, straining 
public finances.
This underscores the importance of strengthening global 
cooperation to foster rapid and equitable vaccine distribution, 
calibrate health and economic policies, enhance debt 
sustainability in the poorest countries and tackle the mounting 
costs of climate change.
Indian Economy
Despite Covid 19 related uncertainties, economic activity 
rebounded sharply in the second half of the year due to successful 
implementation of the world™s largest vaccination drive. 
MANAGEMENT 
DISCUSSION 
AND ANALYSIS
17
By the end of 2021, around 44% of India™s population had been 
completely vaccinated. India™s gross domestic product (GDP) 
for the FY2021-22 expanded to 8.7% which is the highest in 
22 years. The improvement in the economy comes over a GDP 
contraction of 6.6% during 2020-21 due to the pandemic and 
resultant lockdown-imposed curb to arrest the spread of the 
deadly coronavirus.
 
Source: CMIE
Gross Value-Added growth (GVA) during the fiscal ending 
March 2022 was at 8.1 % as against a contraction 4.8 % in the 
preceding year. As per the NSO data, per capita income during 
2021-22 was Rs 1.5 lakh per annum at current prices, up from 
Rs 1.27 lakh in 2020-21, showing a growth of 18.3%. Gross fixed 
capital formation was estimated at Rs 47.84 lakh crore in 2021-
22, up from Rs 41.31 lakh crore in the preceding year.
The economy™s near-term prospects have been darkened by a 
spike in retail inflation, which hit an eight-year high of 7.8% in 
April 2022. The surge in energy and commodity prices following 
the Ukraine crisis is also exerting a drag on economic activity. In 
May 2022, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised the benchmark 
repo rate by 40 basis points in an unscheduled meeting to 
4.40%. In early June interest rates were further increased by 50 
basis points, a second hike within five weeks.
Baring Agriculture Sector, all other sectors experienced 
robust economic growth in FY22
 
Source: MOSPI
Agriculture sector, which was the only silver lining in FY21- 
slowed to 3% in FY22 as against 3.3% last year-all other sectors, 
except financial, real estate and professional services reported 
strong growth. Mining and quarrying sector grew by 11.5% in 
FY22 as compared to a contraction of 8.6% in FY21.
Similarly, manufacturing grew at a good pace of 9.9% as against 
-0.6% last year. Electricity, gas, water supply and other utility 
services segment grew by 7.5% during 2021-22. The segment 
had contracted by 3.6% in the previous fiscal.
Outlook
In June 2022, The World Bank cut India™s economic growth 
forecast for the current fiscal to 7.5% as rising inflation, supply 
chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions taper recovery. This 
is the second time that the World Bank has revised its GDP 
growth forecast for India in the current fiscal 2022-23 (April 2022 
to March 2023). In April, it had trimmed the forecast from 8.7% to 
8.0% and now it is projected at 7.5% as on 07
th
 June, 2022. The 
report said that growth will also be supported by fixed investment 
undertaken by the private sector and by the government, which 
has introduced incentives and reforms to improve the business 
climate. A rise in prices across all items from fuel to vegetables 
and cooking oil pushed WPI or wholesale price-based inflation to 
a record high of 15.1% in April and retail inflation to a near eight-
year high of 7.8%. Subsequently the RBI raised the benchmark 
interest rate by 90 basis points over May and June to 4.9%. The 
World Bank also noted that growth is expected to slow further to 
7.1% in 2023-24.
In India, the focus of the Government spending has shifted toward 
infrastructure investment, labour regulations are being simplified, 
underperforming state-owned assets are being privatised, and 
the logistics sector is expected to be modernized and integrated.
Industry Overview
Indian Plastic Pipes and Fittings Market
Plastic pipes find application in irrigation, real estate construction 
for both residential, commercial and water supply and sanitation 
(WSS) development. In FY21, the industry size is estimated at 
Rs 400bn-420bn showcasing a ~10% CAGR over FY16-FY21 on 
account of increasing demand from irrigation and WSS sectors, 
and continuous replacement demand from metal pipes in 
residential real estate. 
Pipes will continue to form an integral part of infrastructure 
development as they are a cost-effective way to transport water. 
As per multiple estimates, the industry is scheduled to grow 
by 11-12% CAGR over FY21-FY25E and is expected to reach 
Rs 550bn-600bn by FY25E led by the Government™s continued 
focus on increasing farmer income via better irrigation facilities 
and infrastructure, creation and improvement of WSS infra and 
implementation of ‚Housing For All™ schemes. Secondly there is a 
continuous expansion of newer applications for CPVC and HDPE 
pipes and increasing acceptance of UPVC pipes into other 
applications. Recent correction across polymers prices could 
lead to lower industry growth in value terms, as a decrease in 
raw material prices would impact realisations.

UPVC pipes (64-65% of Industry Demand) 
The UPVC pipe segment is expected to grow at 10-11% CAGR 
over FY20-24 largely led by agriculture and plumbing segments. 
As per industry estimates, the segment reported a market size 
of ~Rs 254bn in FY21. About 65% of demand for UPVC pipes 
comes from Irrigation and Agricultural related activities and the 
balance from residential/commercial plumbing. Being the most 
widely used plastic pipes for cold water transportation systems, 
they also find extensive application in swimming pools, industrial 
process lines, saltwater lines and sectors like food & beverages, 
chemical and are appropriate for residential plumbing.
Being a cost effective and low maintenance product, with 
better longevity and durability than Galvanised Iron (GI) pipes, 
this segment has seen rapid replacement of GI pipes that has 
supported the demand growth of UPVC in the past decade. 
Unorganised industry players have an active presence in this 
segment with almost 50% of the industry retailing unbranded 
UPVC products. The UPVC segment is expected to see 
healthy offtake driven by the Government™s several water-
centric initiatives as well as focus on irrigation and agricultural 
infrastructure development. 
CPVC pipes (15-16% of Industry Demand)
 
Chlorinated polyvinyl chloride (CPVC) is a thermoplastic product 
produced by chlorination of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resin used 
for hot and cold-water lines. CPVC pipes are the first choice of 
material for potable water supply across the world and has been 
in use across the world for several years.
Since the late 2000s, CPVC found rapid growth in the Indian 
market. Today, nearly half the plumbing systems in India are 
made of CPVC and this segment has been the fastest growing 
in the plastic pipes industry in the last decade. In FY21, the 
segment saw a market size of Rs 65 bn. CPVC pipes became a 
preferred choice for developers once they were convinced of its 
advantages as better hot water sustenance due to the chlorine 
content, ease of Installation, faster turnaround time and less 
wastage of material. CPVC pipes find extensive use in plumbing 
applications, as well as hot and cold, potable water distribution 
systems. 
The segment although at an early adoption stage in India, has 
been a fast-growing division, due to benefits such as longevity, 
corrosion free, fire resistant, being lead-free, and the ability to 
withstand high temperatures. CPVC is broadly classified into 
two grades, namely (a) Pipe grade and (b) Fittings grade based 
on end use applications. Branded pipes and fittings players 
have historically maintained a strong foothold in this segment 
accounting for almost 80 % of the market, since CPVC is a 
specialized product with most of the raw material being imported 
and technology licensing required with globally renowned 
players. 
HDPE pipes (15% of Industry Demand)
HDPE is a revolutionary thermoplastic used to overcome all 
shortcomings of pipes as a medium for ducting for optical fibre 
and other cables and the flow of fluids. It is popularly used and 
recommended by Consultants and Field Engineers due to its 
high flow efficiency, strength, longevity, low cost of operation 
and maintenance, and a host of other unique features. They 
find application in irrigation, sewerage & drainage, city gas 
distribution and chemical & processing industries. These pipes 
have been gaining prominence over traditional metal and 
cement pipes, due to durability, low maintenance and longevity 
versus metal pipes. Government schemes, such as PMKSY, 
are expected to lend support to the segment. This segment is 
expected to see 10-11% CAGR over FY20-24.
19
PPR pipes (4-5% of Industry demand)
PPR pipes and plumbing solutions are considered the best 
carrier of potable water, due to several preferred characteristics 
including low thermal conductivity Œ which for PPR is very low, 
meaning temperature cannot easily be conducted from the 
outside environment to the liquid in the pipe, and vice versa. This 
factor reduces heat loss or gain during the transferring of hot 
or cold fluids respectively, resulting in energy efficient systems 
and lower insulation costs for PPR piping. Other advantages 
are: Long Service Life & Durability - PPR piping systems can 
remain functional for over 50 years, at a wide range of fluid and 
environmental operating temperatures; Efficient Inner Surface - 
the inner surface of PPR pipe is very smooth and boasts a very 
low friction coefficient, compared to traditional types of piping; 
Chemical & Mechanical Endurance: Compared to traditional 
plastic piping systems, PPR offers very high resistance against 
abrasion by hard particles. This is especially important in cases 
of well water or industrial applications, where the transferred 
liquids may contain abrasive particles.
These pipes, which are used for various industrial purposes, are 
relatively more expensive compared with other plastic pipes, 
which restricts their usage. The PPR segment is expected to 
grow at 6-7% CAGR over FY20-24.
CPVC will continue to remain the fastest 
growing segment with ~15-17% CAGR over 

next 3-4 years, HDPE/DWC and UPVC are 

expected to grow at 10-11% and 8-9% CAGR 

respectively
Organized players continue to derive an edge
 Œ This is led by 
plumber education initiatives, consumer awareness, preference 
for trusted brands & better quality, adherence to BIS standards 
and a better quality of balance sheet
Organized players gain from market consolidation
 
Source - Equirus Securities report Œ July 2021
The share of organized players in the piping industry has 
expanded from ~50% in FY10 to ~67% in FY21. Top-5 players 
have consolidated their position from 22% in FY12 to ~37% in 
FY21 
 
Source - Equirus Securities report Œ July 2021
Over the last few years, branded pipes and fittings companies 
continued to gain strong industry lead and market share from 
unorganized manufacturers and a few larger regional organized 
players facing balance sheet challenges. Over the last few years, 
the larger pipes and fittings brands have continued to plough the 
industry by consistently investing in brand awareness, category 
education, local audience engagements especially in Tier 2 and 
3 towns and cities, and targeted social media and below-the-line 
activities. All such efforts have contributed to greater plumber 
and consumer awareness, importance of quality and adherence 
to BIS standards in pipes, particularly for residential real estate 
projects. The growth of the organized segment has further 
been aided by greater lateral focus on value-added products 
and fittings and product portfolio expansion offered to channel 
partners. Consequently, organized players have become one-
stop solution providers for plumbing applications. Among several 
variants of plastic pipes, demand for UPVC and CPVC have been 
consistently rising owing to affordability, high quality, durability, 
and newer applications.
With stronger focus on tax compliance due to e-invoicing/
GST regulations and stringent adherence to BIS standards, 
unorganized manufacturers continue to be impacted and are 
witnessing shrinking market share. Even in FY22, supply-side 
constraints and raw material cost inflation have hurt unorganized 
players impacting their profitability and balance sheet. Ability 
to build a resilient brand, focus on premiumisation, efficient 
influencer engagement, product innovation and efficient supply 
chain management will enable larger players to drive deeper roots 
into the industry, carve out a better leadership position and gain 
larger market share leaving unorganized players to grapple with 
operating challenges driven by volatility in imported raw material 
supply and stricter tax compliance.

Balancing Risks and Opportunities
A well-established Risk Management System 
that tracks, targets, and mitigates existing 

and emerging risks
Approach to risk management
We have adopted a top-down approach for identifying and 
managing risks across the organisation. In the top-down 
approach, the principal challenges impacting the achievement of 
the organisational objectives have been articulated. Accordingly, 
the risk library comprises key strategic and business risks 
applicable.
Guiding principles
At Prince Pipes, risk management is guided by a set of 
principles that ensure that the procedure abides by the following 
parameters:
Shareholder value based
Risk management is focused on sustaining 
the creation of shareholder value and 

protecting the same against erosion
Business Process based 
Risk management is embedded in 
existing business processes to facilitate 

management of risks across processes on 

an ongoing basis
Assurance in reporting
Risk management provides support in 
establishing correct processes to manage 

current risks and report the effectiveness of 

these processes to stakeholder groups
Regular review
All programs are reviewed on a regular 
basis to ensure its impact in a dynamic 

business environment
Types of risks
Risk description
Mitigation
Industry Risks:
Slowdown 
in economic 
activity
Plumbing, irrigation, water transportation 
and sewerage applications are the key 
segments driving growth in the plastic pipes 
industry. These sectors are dependent on 
the level of activity in residential and non-
residential construction, agriculture, and 
industrial spaces. A slowdown in any of 
these sectors is likely to impact financial 
performance.
Sectors like real estate, agriculture, industrial, etc. are dependent 
on overall economic performance, Government policies & 
regulations, and budget allocations. The increasing Government 
investment in housing and sanitation, building and construction, 
and irrigation and schemes such as, AMRUT, Har Ghar Nal Se 
Jal, Housing for All and Smart Cities are expected to provide 
impetus to the pipes industry. They offer great opportunities for 
organised players like us and allow us to maintain sustainable 
growth.
Raw material 
supply
Increase in raw material prices can affect 
profitability. UPVC, CPVC, HDPE and PPR 
resins are the key raw materials used in 
the production of pipes. Their prices 
depend on crude oil prices. Any upward 
movement in crude oil prices impact raw 
material prices of resins. 
We leverage our long-standing relationships with suppliers and 
try to mitigate raw material price hikes. 
Long-term contracts with suppliers, backed by a well-defined 
inventory management helps us hedge any volatile price 
movement in commodities.
Competition
We operate in an industry that is highly 
competitive. 
To remain relevant and ahead of our peers, we strive to 
strengthen the Company™s competitive strengths. Map 
competitive landscape closely, focus on improving operational 
strengths & efficiencies, periodic strategic meets to stay ahead of 
industry. Our strategically located manufacturing facilities, wide 
distribution network, diverse products, and our ability to provide 
comprehensive plumbing, irrigation and sewerage management 
solutions allow us to maintain significant competitive advantage.
27
Operational Risks
Operational 
efficiency 
Manufacturing operations may be 
impacted due to circumstances not 
completely within the control of the 
Company. Unexpected breakdown or 
technical issues could adversely affect the 
production and/or cost overruns.
Continuous monitoring, periodic review and timely maintenance 
of equipment and infrastructure. Adoption of technology has 
helped gather information related to any potential/ actual 
breakdown, ensuring minimal impact on the operation. Special 
focus to strengthen operations with sustained investments in 
newer technologies.
Logistic and 
Supply Chain
Disruption in supply chain or distribution 
related logistical issues. Other related 
issues might include receipt of material, 
vendor payments issues.
Checks and processes are reviewed and recorded on regular 
basis to take stock of inventory, invoicing processes, stocks and 
dispatched goods management. The Company ensures that the 
receiving department is independent of the purchase and invoice 
processing department. Independent checks are done by bill 
booking department on rates, destination, tonnage claimed, and 
other charges levied (detention, reimbursements, etc.), if any 
after confirmation is received from User department.
Enterprise Risk 
Management 
spanning Anti-
Fraud Control 
Framework
Risks can include counterfeit goods 
circulating in the markets and on-boarding 
of new customers / channel partners / 
distributors accepted without performing 
due diligence.
The risk relating to counterfeit goods has been assessed, and 
appropriate and relevant action has been planned to mitigate 
the risks. Processes are in place to monitor effectiveness of 
such actions, with corrective action undertaken where these are 
ineffective.
Financial Risks
Foreign 
exchange
We import some raw materials and 
equipment used in our manufacturing 
plants. Any unfavourable movements 
in the exchange rate would impact our 
performance.
We constantly evaluate exchange rate exposure arising from 
foreign currency transactions. We enter into a variety of derivative 
financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts, 
interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps to mitigate this 
risk.
Changing 
regulations and 
policies
The Indian Government has imposed an 
antidumping duty (ADD) on CPVC resin / 
compound imports from China and Korea 
for a period of five years (valid up to 
February 2025). This move is followed by 
provisional anti-dumping duty announced 
on August 26, 2019. 
Earlier, CPVC resin was sourced from various geographies, 
including Korea, China, Japan, and Europe. Post Government 
regulation, the Company has stopped sourcing the same 
from China and Korea. Since our raw material imports are not 
concentrated from these geographies, we have been able to 
mitigate this risk to a large extent.
Credit
Majority of our sales to distributors are 
on an open credit basis, with standard 
payment period between 15-30 days. 
Inability to collect the receivables could 
adversely affect our performance.
We purchase raw materials from domestic suppliers on credit 
terms of less than a week and purchase imported raw materials 
on credit terms of 90-150 days. However, the standard payment 
term with distributors is generally between 15-30 days. We use 
working capital facilities to fund the timing difference between 
the payment for raw materials and the receipt of payment 
for manufactured products. In addition, we also use channel 
financing to optimise the working capital requirements and 
improve collections/debtor days.
Regulatory Risks
Regulatory / 
legal 
Evolving regulatory changes in tax, legal 
and industry scenario may impact the 
Company™s performance
A dedicated team regularly monitors all evolving regulations and 
provides timely inputs to the Company for prompt and corrective 
action.
Sustainability
Committed to purpose-led growth
We have deployed systems and processes that are designed to promote responsible manufacturing practices, robust resource 
management and compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Our systematic approach towards reducing carbon footprint and 
creating a positive impact on the environment includes improving energy efficiency, increasing the share of renewables in the energy 
mix while moderating our use of water and minimising waste generation.

Green Initiative:
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (ﬁMCAﬂ) had taken a ﬁGreen 
Initiative in Corporate Governanceﬂ by allowing paperless

The Act and the Listing Regulations have also allowed the 
Company to serve notice/documents/Annual Report to its 
shareholders through electronic mode. 
The Company whole-heartedly appreciates this initiative 
taken by MCA, being an ardent supporter of pro-environment 
causes. Not only will such a move benefit the environment 
but it will also enhance shareholder experience by enabling 
the Company to deliver communications promptly and 
securely and avoid losses/delays in postal transit. It is a step 
in the right direction being efficient both, economically and 
ergonomically. 
As a part of this, the Company is sending notices/documents 
such as Annual Reports and notices by e-mail to the 
members who have registered their e-mail addresses. To 
support this credible move of the Government, the members 
who have not registered their e-mail addresses requested 
to do so at the earliest, in respect of Demat holding through 
their respective Depository Participant (DP) and in respect 
of physical holding through the RTA. 
We wish to inform our members that in addition to receiving 
the documents through your registered e-mail, you can also 
access the same through the Company™s website: https://

to control dangerous conditions, but unsafe activities 
cause 90-95 percent of injuries. Behavior Based Safety 
(BBS) initiative is a formal community-based prevention 
programme aimed at fostering a zero-accident culture. 
Primary objective of BBS was to identify hidden habits and 
environmental factors that predisposed people to the cause. 
The approach to implement BBS in the Company is focused 
on identification of potential hazards & mitigate it through 
HIRA (Hazard Identification & Risk Assessment). Individuals 
were able to conduct their duties in a more responsible 
manner through our initiative of consultation & participation 
of employees in safety related activities.

Auditor™s Report Thereon
The Company™s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
preparation of the other information. The other information 
comprises the information included in the Management 
Discussion and Analysis, Board™s Report including Annexures 
to Board™s Report, Business Responsibility Report, Corporate 
Governance and Shareholder™s Information, but does not include 
the Ind AS financial statements and our auditor™s report thereon.
Our opinion on the accompanying Ind AS financial statements 
does not cover the other information and we do not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the accompanying Ind AS financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, 
in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed on the other information 
obtained prior to the date of this report, we conclude that there is 
a material misstatement of this other information, we are required 
to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. 
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with 
Governance for the Ind AS financial statements
The Company™s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters 
stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation 
of these Ind AS financial statements that give a true and fair 
view of the financial position, financial performance, changes in 
equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the 
accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the 
Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 
of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standard) 
Rules, 2015 as amended from time to time. 
This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act 
for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing 
and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and 
application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments 
and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial 
controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the 
accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant 
to the preparation and presentation of the Ind AS financial 
statements that give a true and fair view and are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the Ind AS financial statements, management is 
responsible for assessing the Company™s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the 
Company™s financial reporting process.
Auditor™s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Ind AS financial 
statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the Ind AS financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an 
auditor™s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud 
or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Ind AS 
financial statements.
As a part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:



the Ind AS financial statements, whether due to fraud or 
error, design and perform audit procedures responsive 
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk 
of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud 
may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.






the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)
(i) of the Companies Act, 2013, we are also responsible 
for expressing our opinion on whether the company has 
adequate internal financial controls system in place and the 
operating effectiveness of such controls.



and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by management.



the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists 
related to events or conditions that may cast significant 
doubt on the Company™s ability to continue as a going 
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, 
we are required to draw attention in our auditor™s report to 
the related disclosures in the Ind AS financial statements or, 
if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained 
up to the date of our auditor™s report. However, future events 
or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue 
as a going concern.





the Ind AS financial statements, including the disclosures, 
and whether the Ind AS financial statements represent 
the underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the Ind AS financial 
statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable 
that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable 
user of the financial statements may be influenced. We consider 
quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the 
scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; 
and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in 
the financial statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, 
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the 
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant 
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement 
that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all 
relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought 
to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related 
safeguards. 
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the Ind AS financial statements of 
the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We 
describe these matters in our auditor™s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter 
should not be communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to 
outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Other matter
The Ind AS financial statements of the Company as on 31st March 
2021 were audited by another auditor whose report dated 12th 
May 2021 expressed an unmodified opinion. We have relied on 
the said Ind AS financial statement for the purpose of confirming

Report on the Internal Financial Controls under section 143(3)(i) 
of the Companies Act, 2013 (ﬁthe Actﬂ)
Opinion
We have audited the internal financial controls over financial 
reporting of 
Prince Pipes and Fittings Limited
 (ﬁthe Companyﬂ), 
as of 31st March 2022, in conjunction with our audit of the Ind AS 
financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that 
date.
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an 
adequate internal financial controls system over financial 
reporting and such internal financial controls over financial 
reporting were operating effectively as at 31st March, 2022, based 
on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established 
by the Company considering the essential components of internal 
control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial 
Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India (‚ICAI™).
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with 
Governance for Internal Financial Controls over Financial 
Reporting 
The Company™s management is responsible for establishing 
and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal 
control over financial reporting criteria established by the 
Company considering the essential components of internal 
control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit issued by ICAI. 
These responsibilities include the design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient 
conduct of its business, including adherence to Company™s 
policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and 
detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness 
of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable 
financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditor™s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's 
internal financial controls over financial reporting based on our 
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial 
Reporting (the ﬁGuidance Noteﬂ) and the Standards on Auditing, 
issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under section 143(10) 
of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial 
controls, both applicable to an audit of Internal Financial Controls 
and, both issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we 
comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit 
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal 
financial controls over financial reporting was established 
and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all 
material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence 
about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system over 
financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit 
of internal financial controls over financial reporting included 
obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over 
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. 
The procedures selected depend on the auditor™s judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement 
of the Ind AS financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the 
internal financial controls system over financial reporting.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting
A company's internal financial control over financial reporting is 
a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding 
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the 
Ind AS financial statements for external purposes in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's 
internal financial control over financial reporting includes those 
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of 
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) 
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as 
necessary to permit preparation of the Ind AS financial statements 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made 
only in accordance with authorizations of management and 
directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance 
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised 
acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could 
have a material effect on the Ind AS financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial 
Reporting
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls 
over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion 
or improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be 
detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal 
Annexure ﬁIIﬂ to Independent Auditor™s Report for the year ended 31st March 2022
[Referred to in paragraph 2 (f) under the heading ﬁReport on other legal and regulatory requirementsﬂ of our report of even date]
105
financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial 
reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures 
may deteriorate.

2. 
 
Significant Accounting Policies:
      
 
  
 
(a )
 
Statement of Compliance:
       
  
 
 
 
The financial statements of the Company are prepared 
in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind 
AS) notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015 as amended by the Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standards) (Amendment) Rules, 2016, 
the relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 (ﬁthe 
Act™™).
 
The financial statements are authorized for issue by the 
Board of Directors of the Company at their meeting held on 
May 19, 2022
 
 
 
          
 
 
(b)
 
Basis of Preparation and Presentation:
     
   
 
 
 
Basis of Preparation:
        
 
 
 
 
The financial statements have been prepared on the 
historical cost basis except for  following assets and 
liabilities:
(i)   
 
Derivative Financial Instruments measured at fair 
value.
(ii)  
 
Certain financial assets and liabilities measured at 
fair value (refer accounting policy regarding financial 
instruments).
(iii) 
 
Employee™s Defined Benefit Plan as per actuarial 
valuation.
 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an 
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date, 
regardless of whether that price is directly observable or 
estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating 
the fair value of an asset or liability, the Company takes into 
account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market 
participants would take those characteristic into account 
when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. 
 
 
 
 
 
Functional and Presentation Currency:
     
   
 
 
 
The financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees, 
which is the functional currency of the Company and 
currency of primary economic environment in which 
company operates. All amounts disclosed in financial 
statements which also include the accompanying notes have 
been rounded off to nearest million as per the requirement 
of Schedule III to the Companies Act 2013, unless otherwise 
stated.
 
 
 
 
Operating Cycle :
         
 
 
 
 
The Company has ascertained its operating cycle as 
twelve months for the purpose of Current / Non-Current 
classification of its Assets and Liabilities.
 
An asset is treated as current when it is:
(i)   Expected to be realized or intended to be sold or 
consumed in normal operating cycle;
(ii)  
 
Held primarily for the purpose of trading, or
(iii) 
 
Expected to be realized within twelve months after the 
reporting period, or
(iv) 
 
Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being 
exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least 
twelve months after the reporting period 
 
All other assets are classified as non-current. 
 
A liability is current when:
(i)   
 
It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle;
(ii)  
 
It is held primarily for the purpose of trading.
(iii) 
 
It is due to be settled within twelve months after the 
reporting period, or
(iv) 
 
There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement 
of the liability for at least twelve months after the 
reporting period. Terms of liability that could result 
in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments 
at the option of the counterparty does not affect this 
classification. 
  
All other liabilities are classified as non-current. 
 
Company Overview and Significant Accounting Policies
(c )
 
Property, plant and equipment (PPE) :
     
   
 
 
 
The initial cost of PPE comprises its purchase price, 
including import duties and non-refundable purchase 
taxes, and any directly attributable costs of bringing an 
asset to working condition and location for its intended use, 
including relevant borrowing costs and any expected costs 
of decommissioning. Subsequent expenditures related to an 
item of Property, plant and equipment are added to its book 
value only if they meet the definition of PPE as specified in 
Ind AS 16 Œ Property, Plant and Equipment.
 
Expenditure/ Income during construction period (including 
financing cost related to borrowed funds for construction or 
acquisition of qualifying PPE) is included under Capital Work-
in-Progress, and the same is allocated to the respective PPE 
on the completion of their construction. Advances given 
towards acquisition or construction of PPE outstanding at 
each reporting date are disclosed as Capital Advances under 
ﬁOther non-current Assetsﬂ.
 
Material items such as spare parts, stand-by equipment and 
service equipment are classified as PPE when they meet the 
definition of PPE as specified in Ind AS 16 Œ Property, Plant 
and Equipment.
 
If significant part of an item of PPE have different useful life, 
then they are accounted for as separate items of PPE.
 
 
 
(d)
 
Depreciation:
 
         
 
 
 
Depreciable amount for PPE is the cost of an PPE less its 
estimated residual value. Depreciation on PPE are charged 
based on straight line method on an estimated useful life as 
prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 or as 
per technical assessment.

Intangible assets :
         
 
 
 
 
Intangible assets acquired separately
     
   
 
 
 
Intangible assets that are acquired separately with 
finite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment, if any. The 
Company determines the amortisation period as the period 
over which the future economic benefits will flow to the 
Company after taking into account all relevant facts and 
circumstances. The estimated useful life and amortisation 
method are reviewed periodically, with the effect of any 
changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective 
basis. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not 
amortized, but are tested for impairment annually, either 
individually or at the cash-generating unit level
 
 
 
 
Derecognition of intangible assets
 
 
An intangible asset is derecognized on disposal, or when no 
future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. 
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible 
asset are recognized in the statement of profit and loss 
when the asset is derecognized.
 
 
 
 
Internally generated Intangible assets (Research and 
Development expenditure)
     
 
 
 
Expenditure pertaining to research is expensed as incurred. 
Expenditure incurred on development is capitalised if such 
expenditure leads to creation of an asset, otherwise such 
expenditure is charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss.

Useful lives of intangible assets are as under:

(f)
 
Impairment of Non-Financial Assets :
     
   
 
 
 
At the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews 
the carrying amounts of non-financial assets to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets have 
suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, 
the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in 
order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if 
any). When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable 
amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which 
the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis 
of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also 
allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise 
they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating 
units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis 
can be identified.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs 
of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present 
value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future 
cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating 
unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the 
carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is 
reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is 
recognised immediately in Statement of Profit and Loss, 
unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in 
which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation 
decrease.
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the 
carrying amount of the asset (or a cash-generating unit) is 
increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, 
but to the extent that the increased carrying amount does 
not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for 
the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal 
of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss, unless the relevant asset is 
carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of 
the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
 
 
(g)
 
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held 
for disposal :
 
     
 
 
 
Non-current assets are classified as held for disposal if their 
carrying amount will be recovered principally through a 
sale transaction rather than through continuing use.  Such 
assets are measured at lower of their carrying amount and 
fair value less costs to sell
 
To classify any  asset as  "Asset held for disposal" the asset 
must be available for immediate sale in its present condition 
subject only to terms that are usual and customary for 
sales of such assets and its sale is highly probable. Also, 
Management must be committed to the sale, which should 
be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale 
within a year from the date of classification. Once classified 
as held for disposal, intangible assets and PPE are no longer 
amortised or depreciated.
 
 
 
(h)
 
Inventories :
          
 
 
 
Raw materials, stores & spare parts and packing materials:
 
 
Valued at lower of cost and net realisable value (NRV). 
However, these items are considered to be realisable at 
cost, if the finished products, in which they will be used, 
are expected to be sold at or above cost. Cost is determined 
on first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis. The cost of inventory 
comprises its purchase price, including non-refundable 
purchase taxes, and any directly attributable costs related 
to the inventories.
 
 
 
 
Work-in- progress (WIP), finished goods, stock-in-trade :
 
Valued at lower of cost and NRV. Cost of Finished goods 
and WIP includes cost of raw materials, direct labour, other 
direct costs and related production overheads upto the 
relevant stage of completion.
 
 
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the 
ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of 
completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the 
sale.
 
 
 
(i)
 
Employee Benefits :
 
        
 
 
 
 
Employee benefits include Gratuity, Provident Fund, 
Employee Family Pension, Employee State Insurance 
Scheme, Compensated Absences and share based 
payments.
 
 
 
 
 
Defined benefit plans:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For defined benefit plans, the cost of providing benefits is 
determined using the projected unit credit method, with 
actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each 
annual reporting period. Re-measurement, comprising 
actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the changes to the 
asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on plan assets 
(excluding net interest), is reflected immediately in the 
Balance Sheet with a charge or credit recognised in Other 
Comprehensive Income (OCI) in the period in which they 
occur. Re-measurement recognised in OCI is reflected 
immediately in retained earnings and will not be reclassified 
to Statement of Profit and Loss. Past service cost is 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period 
of a plan amendment. Net interest is calculated by applying 
the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net 
defined benefit liability or asset. Defined benefit costs are 
categorised as follows:
(i)   
 
service cost (including current service cost, past service 
cost, as well as gains and losses on curtailments and 
settlements);
(ii)  
 
net interest expense or income; and
(iii) 
 
re-measurement
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is 
calculated using a discount rate which is determined by 
reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period 
on government bonds.
The defined benefit obligation recognised in the Balance 
Sheet represents the actual deficit or surplus in the 
Company™s defined benefit plans. Any surplus resulting 
from this calculation is limited to the present value of any 
economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the 
plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans.
 
 
 
 
Defined Contribution Plan:
       
  
 
 
 
The Company™s contribution to Provident Fund and  Pension 
Fund is considered as defined contribution plans and are 
charged as an expense based on the amount of contribution 
required to be made and when services are rendered by the 
employees. Company has no further obligation beyond its 
contributions
 
 
 
            
 
Short-term employee benefits:
      
   
 
 
 
The undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits 
expected to be paid in exchange for the services rendered 
by employees are recognized during the year when the 
employees render the service. These benefits include 
compensated absences which are expected to occur within 
twelve months after the end of the period in which the 
employee renders the related service.
 
 
 
 
Long-term employee benefits:
 
     
   
 
 
 
Accumulated compensated absences, which are expected to 
be availed or encashed beyond 12 months from the end of 
the year are treated as other long-term employee benefits. 
The company's liability is actuarially determined (using 
the Projected Unit Credit method) at the end of each year. 
Actuarial losses/gains are recognised in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss in the year in which they arise.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Employee Share based payment:
      
   
 
 
 
Equity settled share based payments to employees are 
measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the 
grant date. 
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity 
settled share based payments is amortised on a straight 
line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company™s 
estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with 
a corresponding increase in equity.
At the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its 
estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to 
vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if 
any, is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss such 
that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, 
with a corresponding adjustment to the equity-settled 
employee benefits reserve.
 
 
 
            
(j)
 
Borrowing costs :
         
 
 
 
 
Borrowing cost (General and Specific) includes interest 
(calculated as per effective interest method), amortization of 
ancillary costs incurred in connection with the arrangement 
of borrowings and exchange differences arising from foreign 
currency borrowings to the extent they are regarded as an 
adjustment to the interest cost.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of qualifying assets, which are 
assets that necessarily takes a substantial period of time 
to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to 
the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are 
substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Interest income earned on the temporary investment of 
specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying 
assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for 
capitalization.
All other borrowing costs are recognized in the statement of 
profit and loss in the period in which they are incurred.
117
(k)
 
Foreign Currencies :
  
       
 
 
 
In preparing the financial statements of the Company, 
transactions in currencies other than the Company™s 
functional currency (i.e. foreign currencies) are recognised 
at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary 
items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at 
the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items carried 
at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies 
are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the 
fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are 
measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency 
are translated using the exchange rate as at the date of 
initial transactions.
 
Exchange differences on monetary items are recognised in 
the 
 
Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they 
arise except for, exchange differences on foreign currency 
borrowings relating to assets under construction for future 
productive use, which are included in the cost of those 
assets when they are regarded as an adjustment to interest 
costs on those foreign currency borrowings.

Revenue Recognition  :
 
       
 
 
a
 
Revenue from operations
       
  
 
 
 
 
Revenue is recognized on the basis of approved 
contracts regarding the transfer of goods or services 
to a customer for an amount that reflects the 
consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled 
in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue is 
measured at the fair value of consideration received or 
receivable taking into account the amount of discounts, 
rebates, outgoing taxes on sales of goods or services.
Revenue from contract with customer are recognised 
when goods are dispatched and the control over the 
goods sold are transferred to customers.
Revenue from turnkey contracts having performance 
obligation to be fulfilled over the time are recognised 
measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction 
of that performance obligation. The Company measures 
the progress using the Output method. 
Costs to fulfill a contract which is directly related to 
a contract or to an anticipated contract, generates or 
enhance resources of the Company that will be used 
in satisfying performance obligations in the future and 
expected to be recovered are recognised as an Asset
Variable consideration includes discounts and 
incentives provided to the customers. It is estimated 
at contract inception considering the terms of 
contract with customers and constrained until it is 
highly probable that a significant revenue reversal 
in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will 
not occur when the associated uncertainty with the 
variable consideration is subsequently resolved. It is 
reassessed at end of each reporting period. 
Generally, the Company receives short-term advances 
from its customers. The Company does not expect 
to have any contracts where the period between the 
transfer of goods and payment by customer exceeds 
one year. Hence, the Company does not adjust revenue 
for the time value of money.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other Income
 
        
 
 
 
(i)    Dividend Income is accounted for when the right to 
receive the income is established.
(ii)
 
Interest income is recognized on time proportion 
basis taking into account the amount outstanding 
on effective interest rate.
(iii) 
 
Difference between the sale price and carrying 
value of investment is recognised as profit or loss 
on sale / redemption on investment on trade date 
of transaction.
 
 
 
(m)
 
Government Grants
 
        
 
 
Government Grants, related to assets, are recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss on a systematic basis over the 
periods in which the Company recognises the related costs 
for which the grants are intended to compensate. 
Government grants related to income are recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they 
become receivable.
Government grants are not recognised until there is 
reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with 
the conditions attached to them  and that the grants will be 
received.
 
 
 
 
 
(n)
 
Lease:
 
         
 
 
n.1 
 
The Company as a Lessee:
 
The Company, at the inception of a contract, assesses 
whether the contract is a lease or not lease. A contract 
is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right 
to control the use of an identified asset for a time in 
exchange for a consideration.
 
The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and 
a lease liability at the lease commencement date. 
The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, 
which comprises the initial amount of the lease 
liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or 
before the commencement date, plus any initial direct 
costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle 
and remove the underlying asset or to restore the 
underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less 
any lease incentives received. 
 
The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated 
using the straight-line method from the commencement 
date to the end of the lease term. The right-of-use 
asset is periodically reviewed for impairment losses, if 
any, and adjusted for certain re-measurements of the 
lease liability.
 
The lease liability is initially measured at the present 
value of the lease payments that are not paid at 
the commencement date, discounted using the the 
Company™s incremental borrowing rate. 
 
Lease payments included in the measurement of the 
lease liability comprise the following:
 Œ 
 
fixed payments, including in-substance fixed 
payments;
 Œ 
 
variable lease payments that depend on an index or a 
rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the 
commencement date;
 Œ 
 
amounts expected to be payable under a residual value 
guarantee; and
 Œ 
 
the exercise price under a purchase option that the 
company is reasonably certain to exercise, 
lease payments in an optional renewal period if 
the company is reasonably certain to exercise an 
extension option, and penalties for early termination of 
a lease unless the company is reasonably certain not 
to terminate early
It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease 
payments arising from a change in an index or rate, 
if there is a change in the Company™s estimate of the 
amount expected to be payable under a residual value 
guarantee, or if the Company changes its assessment 
of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension 
or termination option. When the lease liability is 
remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is 
made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, 
or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of 
the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.
 
 
 
n.2 
 
Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
 
 
 
 
The Company has chosen not to recognise right-of-use 
assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that 
have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of 
low-value assets. The Company recognises the lease 
payments associated with these leases as an expense 
over the lease term.
 
 
 
  
 
 
(o)
 
Income Taxes:
 
         
 
 
 
Tax expense represents the sum of the current tax and 
deferred tax.
 
 
 
             
Current Tax 
 
         
 
 
 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the 
year. Current tax is measured at the amount expected to be 
paid to the tax authorities, based on estimated tax liability 
computed after taking credit for allowances and exemption 
in accordance with the local tax laws. The Company™s 
current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting 
period.
 
 
Deferred tax
 
          
 
 
 
Deferred tax is provided, on all temporary differences at the 
reporting date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax 
rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary 
differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. 
Tax relating to items recognised directly in equity or OCI is 
recognised in equity or OCI and not in the Statement Profit 
and Loss.
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a 
legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and 
assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same 
tax authority.
119
 
A deferred tax asset is recognized to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax 
assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced 
to the extent that it is no longer probable.
 
 
 
 
 
(p)
 
Earnings per share :
  
       
 
 
 
 
A basic earnings p
er share is computed by dividing the 
profit/(loss) after tax for the year attributable to equity 
shareholders by the weighted average number of equity 
shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per 
share is computed by dividing the profit/(loss) after tax  
for the year attributable to equity shareholders by the 
weighted average number of equity shares considered for 
deriving basic earnings per share and the weighted average 
number of equity shares which could have been issued on 
the conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.
 
Potential equity shares are deemed to be dilutive only if their 
conversion to equity shares would decrease the net profit 
per share from continuing ordinary operations. Potential 
dilutive equity shares are deemed to be converted as at 
the beginning of the period, unless they have been issued 
at a later date. The dilutive potential equity shares are 
adjusted for the proceeds receivable had the shares been 
actually issued at fair value (i.e. average market value of 
the outstanding shares). Dilutive potential equity shares are 
determined independently for each period presented.
 
(q)
 
Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets 
and Commitments :
  
    
 
 
 
Provisions are recognized when the Company has a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, 
it is probable that the Company will be required to settle 
the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligation.
The amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate 
of the consideration required to settle the present obligation 
at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the 
risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligations. When 
a provision is measured using the cash flow estimated to 
settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the 
present obligations of those cash flows (when the effect of 
the time value of money is material).
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle 
a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, 
a receivable is recognized as an asset if it is virtually certain 
that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the 
receivable can be measured reliably.
Contingent liabilities and Contingent assets are not 
recognized in the financial statements.
 
 
 
Contingent assets are not recognised in financial statements 
since this may result in the recognition of income that may 
never be realised. However, when the realisation of income 
is virtually certain, then the related asset is not a contingent 
asset and is recognised. A contingent asset is disclosed, in 
financial statements, where an inflow of economic benefits 
is probable.
 
 
 
 
 
(r )
 
Financial Instruments:
        
 
 
 
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when 
a Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instruments.
 
 
 
 
Initial Recognition
         
 
 
 
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured 
at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable 
to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial 
liabilities (other than  financial assets and financial liabilities 
at fair value through profit or loss and ancillary costs related 
to borrowings) are added to or deducted from the fair value 
of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, 
on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable 
to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at 
fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately 
in Statement of Profit and Loss.
 
 
 
 
Classification and Subsequent Measurement: Financial 
Assets
 
  
    
 
 
 
The Company classifies financial assets as subsequently 
measured at amortised cost, fair value through other 
comprehensive income (ﬁFVOCIﬂ) or fair value through profit 
or loss (ﬁFVTPLﬂ) on the basis of following:
(i)  
 
the entity™s business model for managing the financial 
assets and
(ii)
 
the contractual cash flow characteristics of the 
financial asset.
 
 
 
 
Amortised Cost
 
        
 
 
 
 
A financial asset shall be classified and measured at 
amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met:
(i)  
 
the financial asset is held within a business model 
whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to 
collect contractual cash flows and
(ii)
 
the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on 
specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments 
of principal and interest on the principal amount 
outstanding.
 
 
 
 
In case of financial asset classified and measured at 
amortised cost, any interest income, foreign exchange gains/
losses and impairment are recognised in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fair Value through OCI
        
 
 
 
 
A financial asset shall be classified and measured at fair 
value through OCI if both of the following conditions are 
met:
(i)  
 
the financial asset is held within a business model 
whose objective is achieved by both collecting 
contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and
(ii) 
 
the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on 
specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments 
of principal and interest on the principal amount 
outstanding.
 
Where the Company has elected to present the fair value 
gain on equity instruments in other comprehensive income, 
there is no subsequent classification of fair value gain 
or losses to profit and loss account. Dividend from such 
instruments is recognized in profit and loss account as other 
income where right to receive is established.
 
 
 
 
Fair Value through Profit or Loss
      
   
 
 
 
A financial asset shall be classified and measured at 
fair value through profit or loss unless it is measured at 
amortised cost or at fair value through OCI. All recognised 
financial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety 
at either amortised cost or fair value, depending on the 
classification of the financial assets. For financial assets at 
fair value through profit or loss, net gain or losses, including 
any interest or dividend income are recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
 
 
 
 
Classification and Subsequent Measurement: Financial 
liabilities
  
     
 
 
 
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities 
at FVTPL or ‚other financial liabilities™.
 
 
 
 
Financial Liabilities at FVTPL
       
  
 
 
 
Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL when the 
financial liability is held for trading or are designated upon 
initial recognition as FVTPL. Gains or Losses on liabilities 
held for trading are recognised in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss.
 
 
 
 
Other Financial Liabilities
       
  
 
 
 
Other financial liabilities (including borrowings and trade and 
other payables) are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense 
(based on effective interest method), foreign exchange 
gains and losses and any gain or loss on derecognition is 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
 
 
 
 
Impairment of financial assets
       
  
 
 
 
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for 
indicators of impairment at the end of each reporting period. 
The Company recognises a loss allowance for expected 
credit losses on financial asset. In case of trade receivables, 
the Company follows the simplified approach permitted 
by Ind AS 109 Œ Financial Instruments for recognition of 
impairment loss allowance. The application of simplified 
approach does not require the Company to track changes 
in credit risk. The Company calculates the expected credit 
losses on trade receivables using a provision matrix on the 
basis of its historical credit loss experience.
 
 
 
 
Derecognition of financial assets
      
   
 
 
 
 
The Company derecognises a financial asset when the 
contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or 
when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the 
risks and rewards of the asset or if, the Company has neither 
transferred nor retained substantially all risk and reward of 
the asset, but has transferred control of the asset to another 
party. 
 
On derecognition of a financial asset, other than investments 
classified as FVOCI, in its entirety, the difference between the 
asset™s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration 
received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that 
had been recognised in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated in equity is recognised in profit or loss if such 
gain or loss would have otherwise been recognised in profit 
or loss on disposal of that financial asset.
121
 
On derecognition of equity investments classified as FVOCI, 
accumulated gains or loss recognised in OCI is transferred 
to retained earnings.
 
 
 
 
 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(i) 
 
Classification as debt or equity
 
Debt and equity instruments issued by the Company 
are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity 
in accordance with the substance of the contractual 
arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability 
and an equity instrument.
(ii) 
 
Equity instruments
 
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences 
a residual interest in the assets of an entity after 
deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued 
by a Company are recognised at the proceeds received.
(s)
 
Cash and cash equivalents :
       
  
 
 
 
Cash and cash equivalents in the Balance Sheet comprise 
cash at bank, Cash in hand and short-term deposits with 
banks that are readily convertible into cash which are subject 
to insignificant risk of changes in value and are held for the 
purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments.
 
 
 
(t)
 
Derivative financial instruments :
 
     
   
 
 
 
The Company enters into derivative financial instruments 
viz. foreign exchange forward contracts and cross currency 
swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate, foreign 
exchange rate risks and commodity prices. The Company 
does not hold derivative financial instruments for speculative 
purposes.
 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the 
derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting 
period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or 
loss immediately excluding derivatives designated as cash 
flow hedge. 
 
 
 
(u)
 
Hedge accounting:
         
 
 
 
 
The Company designates certain hedging instruments in 
respect of foreign currency risk and interest rate risk price 
risk as cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge 
relationship, the entity documents the relationship between 
the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its 
risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking 
various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of 
the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Company documents 
whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in 
offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged 
item attributable to the hedged risk.
 
 
 
 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the 
designated portion of derivatives that qualify as cash flow 
hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated under equity. The gain or loss relating to the 
ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or 
loss.
 
 
 
 
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in equity relating to effective 
portion as described above are reclassified to profit or loss 
in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss, in 
the same line as the recognised hedged item. However, when 
the hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of 
a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, such gains 
and losses are transferred from equity and included in the 
initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or 
non-financial liability.
 
 
 
 
Hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when 
the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or 
exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. 
Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income 
and accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity and 
is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately 
recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is 
no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in 
equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
 
 
 
           
(v)
 
Cash Flow Statement:
 
       
 
 
 
 
Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby 
the net profit before tax is adjusted for the effects of 
transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals 
of past or future operating cash receipts or payments 
and item of income or expenses associated with investing 
or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, 
investing and financing activities of the Company are 
segregated.
 
 
 
(w)
 
Segment Reporting
:
         
 
 
 
Operating segments are defined as components of an 
enterprise for which discrete financial information is 
available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating 
decision maker, in deciding how to allocate resources and 
assessing performance. The Companies chief operating 
decision maker is the Managing Director.
 
 
 
3. 
 
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty 
 
     
 
 
The preparation of the Company™s financial statements 
requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, 
expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying 
disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. 
Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could 
result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the 
carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future 
periods.
 
 
 
 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
     
   
 
 
 
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key 
sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that 
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the 
next financial year, are described below. The Company 
based its assumptions and estimates on parameters 
available when the financial statements were prepared. 
Existing circumstances and assumptions about future 
developments, however, may change due to market changes 
or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the 
Company. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions 
when they occur.
 
 
 
(i)
 
Useful lives of property, plant and equipment :
  
     
 
 
 
The Company uses its technical expertise along with 
historical and industry trends for determining the 
economic life of an asset/component of an asset. The 
useful lives are reviewed by management periodically 
and revised, if appropriate. In case of a revision, the 
unamortised depreciable amount is charged over the 
remaining useful life of the assets.
 
 
 
(ii) 
 
Defined benefit obligation :
      
   
 
 
 
The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and the 
present value of the gratuity obligation are determined 
using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation 
involves making various assumptions that may differ 
from actual developments in the future. These include 
the determination of the discount rate, future salary 
increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities 
involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a 
defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes 
in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at 
each reporting date.
 
 
 
(iii) 
 
Fair value measurement of Financial Instruments :
  
     
 
 
 
When the fair values of financial assets and financial 
liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be 
measured based on quoted prices in active markets, 
their fair value is measured using valuation techniques 
including the Discounted Cash Flow model. The inputs 
to these models are taken from observable markets 
where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree 
of judgement is required in establishing fair values. 
Judgements include considerations of inputs such as 
liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility.
 
 
 
(iv) 
 
Income taxes :
 
        
 
 
 
 
 
Significant judgements are involved in estimating 
budgeted profits for the purpose of paying advance tax, 
determining the provision for income taxes, including 
amount expected to be paid/recovered for uncertain 
tax positions.
 
 
 
 
(v) 
 
Revenue from turnkey project :
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Company has recognised revenue and cost from 
this project. Due to the nature of the project, recognition 
of revenue and cost involves usage of percentage 
of completion method which is determined based on 
the progress towards complete satisfaction of that 
performance obligation, which involves significant 
judgments, identification of contractual obligations 
and the Company™s rights to receive payments for 
performance completed till date.
 
(vi) 
 
Leases :
          
 
 
 
The Company considers all the extension-options 
under the commercial contract for determining the 
lease-term which forms the basis for the measurement 
of right-of-use asset and the corresponding lease-
liability.
 
 
 
(vii) 
 
Share-based payments :
       
  
 
 
 
The Company measures the cost of equity-settled 
transactions with employees using Black-Scholes 
model to determine the fair value of the liability incurred 
on the grant date. Estimating fair value for share-based 
payment transactions requires determination of the 
most appropriate valuation model, which is dependent 
on the terms and conditions of the grant.  This estimate 
also requires determination of the most appropriate 
inputs to the valuation model including the expected 
life of the share option, volatility and dividend yield and 
123
making assumptions about them. The assumptions and 
models used for estimating fair value for share-based 
payment transactions are disclosed in Note 36.
 
 
 
(viii) 
 
Discount, Incentives & Rebates :
     
   
 
 
 
Revenue is measured net of discounts, incentives, 
rebates etc. given to the customers on the 
Company™s sales. The Company™s presence across 
different marketing regions within the country and

New Ind AS and amendments to existing Ind AS issued but 
not effective as at 31st March 2022
 
    
 
 
Ministry of Corporate Affairs has notified new standards 
or amendments to the existing standards which would be 
effective from 1st April, 2022.
 
 
 
a. 
 
Ind AS 16 - Proceeds before intended use
   
     
 
 
 
The amendment clarifies that excess of net sale 
proceeds of items produced over the cost of testing, 
if any, shall not be recognised in the profit or loss 
but deducted from the directly attributable costs 
considered as part of cost of an item of property, 
plant, and equipment. The effective date for adoption 
of this amendment is annual periods beginning on or 
after April 1, 2022. The Company has evaluated the 
amendment and there is no impact on its financial 
statements.
 
 
 
b.
 
Ind AS 37 - Onerous Contracts - Costs of Fulfilling a 
Contract
 
 
     
 
 
 
The amendments specify that the ‚cost of fulfilling™ a 
contract comprises the ‚costs that relate directly to 
the contract™. Costs that relate directly to a contract 
can either be incremental costs of fulfilling that 
contract (examples would be direct labour, materials) 
or an allocation of other costs that relate directly to 
fulfilling contracts. The amendment is essentially 
a clarification and the Company does not expect 
the amendment to have any significant impact in its 
financial statements.
 
 
c. 
 
Ind AS 103 - Reference to Conceptual Framework
  
     
 
 
 
The amendments specify that to qualify for recognition 
as part of applying the acquisition method, the 
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
must meet the definitions of assets and liabilities in the 
Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting under 
Indian Accounting Standards (Conceptual Framework) 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India at the acquisition date. These changes do not 
significantly change the requirements of Ind AS 103. 
The Company does not expect the amendment to have 
any significant impact in its financial statements.
 
 
 
d. 
 
Ind AS 109 - Annual Improvement to Ind AS (2021)
  
     
 
 
 
 
The amendment clarifies which fees an entity includes 
when it applies the ‚10%™ test of Ind AS 109 in assessing 
whether to derecognise a financial liability. The 
Company does not expect the amendment to have any 
significant impact in its financial statements.

A. 
 
Market Risk
   
       
Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash flows that may result from a change in the price 
of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign 
currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. 
Market risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including investments and deposits, foreign currency 
receivables, payables and borrowings.
          
          
1) 
 
Foreign Currency risk
 
         
Foreign currency risk is the risk of impact related to fair value or future cash flows of an exposure in foreign currency, which 
fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company™s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange 
rates relates primarily to import of raw materials, capital expenditure and exports. When a derivative is entered for the 
purpose of being a hedge, the Company negotiates the terms of those derivatives to match the terms of the hedged exposure.
 
 
The Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from foreign currency transactions. The Company follows established 
risk management policies and procedures. It uses derivative instruments like foreign currency forwards and cross currency 
swaps to hedge exposure to foreign currency risk.

Interest Rate Risk
         
 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash 
flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of 
changes in market interest rates. The company's exposure to 
the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily 
to the company's term loans and short term borrowing with 
floating interest rate. For foreign currency loan with floating 
rate, the risk of variation in interest rate is mitigated through 
cross currency swap. The company constantly monitors the 
credit markets and rebalances its financing strategies to 
achieve an optimal maturity profile and financing cost.

Cash Flow Hedges
         
   
 
In the earlier years, the Company had raised foreign 
currency external commercial borrowings and to mitigate 
the risk of foreign currency and floating interest rates the 
Company had taken Cross Currency Swaps. There is no 
outstanding foreign external commercial borrowings as 
at 31st March, 2022 and 31st March, 2021. The Company 
had followed hedge accounting for the foreign currency 
borrowings raised based on qualitative approach. 
 
The Company had assessed the hedge effectiveness based 
on following criteria: 
(i) 
 
an economic relationship between the hedged item 
and the hedging instrument;
(ii) 
 
the effect of credit risk; and

Commodity Price Risk
        
 
   
Commodity price risk for the Company is mainly related to 
fluctuations in raw material prices linked to various external 
factors, which can affect the production cost of the Company. 
To manage this risk, the Company monitors factors affecting 
prices, identifies new sources of supply of raw material, 
monitors inventory level, etc.
       
     
B. 
 
Credit Risk Management
        
    
Credit risk arises when a customer or counterparty does not 
meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer 
contract, leading to a financial loss. The Company is exposed 
to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade 
receivables) and from its financing / investing activities, 
including deposits with banks, foreign exchange transactions 
and financial guarantees. The Company has no significant 
concentration of credit risk with any counterparty.
   
         
Trade Receivable
         
   
Trade receivables are consisting of a large number of 
customers / distributors. The Company has credit evaluation 
policy for each customer / distributor and based on the 
evaluation credit limit of each customer / distributor is 
defined.
           
 
Total trade receivable as on March 31, 2022 Rs. 4,346.17 
million (March 31, 2021 is Rs. 3,308.02 million). There are 
no customers which account for more than 10% of the 
company's total revenue from operations for the year ended 
31st March, 2022 and 31st March, 2021. 
     
As per simplified approach, the Company makes provision of 
expected credit losses on trade receivables using a provision 
matrix to mitigate the risk of default payments and makes 
appropriate provision at each reporting date wherever 
outstanding is for longer period and involves higher risk. 
The policy for creating provision for credit losses on trade 
receivables is as per following provision matrix:- 
   
    
Particular 
Loss 
Allowance

Investments, Derivative Instruments, Cash and Cash

Credit Risk on cash and cash equivalent, deposits with 
the banks / financial institutions is generally low as the 
said deposits have been made with the banks / financial 
institutions who have been assigned high credit rating by 
international and domestic rating agencies.
    
        
Credit Risk on Derivative Instruments are generally low 
as Company enters into the Derivative Contracts with the 
reputed Banks and Financial Institutions.
     
  
C. 
 
Liquidity Risk
          
  
 
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company will 
not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at 
reasonable price. Prudent liquidity risk management implies 
maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities and 
the availability of funding through an adequate amount of 
credit facilities to meet obligations when due. In addition, 
processes and policies related to such risks are overseen by 
senior management. Management monitors the Company™s 
liquidity position through rolling forecasts on the basis of 
expected cash flows.

Fair Value measurements (Ind AS 113)
      
      
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are included 
at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in 
an orderly transaction in the principal (or most advantageous) 
market at measurement date under the current market condition 
regardless of whether that price is directly observable or 
estimated using other valuation techniques. The Company has 
established the following fair value hierarchy that categorises 
the values into 3 levels. The inputs to valuation techniques used 
to measure fair value of financial instruments are:
 
Level 1: This hierarchy uses quoted (unadjusted) prices in active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities. The fair value of all quoted 
investments which are traded in the stock exchanges is valued 
using the closing price or dealer quotations as at the reporting date. 
 
 
Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded 
in an active market is determined using valuation techniques 
which maximize the use of observable market data and rely 
as little as possible on company specific estimates. Unquoted 
investments are valued using the closing Net Asset Value. If 
all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are 
observable, the instrument is included in Level 2. 
 
Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on 
observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.

The management assessed that cash and bank balances, trade 
receivables, trade payables, cash credits and other financial 
assets and liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely 
due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
   
         
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate 
the fair values:
(a) 
 
The fair values of the quoted investments are based on 
market price/net asset value at the reporting date. 
(b)
 
The fair value of unquoted investments is based on closing 
Net Assets Value.
(c) 
 
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is 
calculated as the present value determined using forward 
exchange rates and interest rate curve of the respective 
currencies.
(d) 
 
The fair value of currency swap is calculated as the present 
value determined using forward exchange rates, currency 
basis spreads between the respective currencies, interest 
rate curves and an appropriate discount factor.
(e) 
 
The fair value of the remaining financial instruments is 
determined using discounted cash flow analysis. The 
discount rates used is based on management estimates.

The Hon™ble Supreme Court of India (ﬁSCﬂ) by their order 
dated February 28, 2019, in the case of Surya Roshani 
Limited & others v/s EPFO, set out the principles based 
on which allowances paid to the employees should be 
identified for inclusion in basic wages for the purposes 
of computation of Provident Fund contribution.  Pending 
directions or clarification from the EPFO, the quantification 
of impact, if any, is not ascertainable and consequently no 
effect has been given in the accounts.

 Asset Liability matching strategy: 
 
             
 
The money contributed by the Company to the Gratuity fund to finance the liabilities of the plan has to be invested for funded 
gratuity plan. The Company has outsourced the investment management of the fund to an Insurance Company. The Insurance 
Company in turn manages these funds as per the permissible limits prescribed in the insurance regulation. Due to the restriction 
in the type of investment that can be held by the fund,it is not possible to explicitly follow an asset libility matching strategy. 
There is no compulsion on the part of the Company to fully prefund the liability of the Plan.

The Company™s expected contribution during next year is Rs. NIL (March 31, 2021 of Rs. NIL).
