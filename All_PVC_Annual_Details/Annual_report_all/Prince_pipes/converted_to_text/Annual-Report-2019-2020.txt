Chairman™s Message
Mr. Jayant Chheda
Chairman and Managing Director
Dear Shareholders,
It gives me immense pride to present to 
you the first Annual Report of Prince Pipes 
and Fittings Limited since the Company™s 
successful listing on the BSE Limited (BSE) 
and National Stock Exchange of India 
Limited (NSE) in the month of December 
2019. I thank all our shareholders for your 
enthusiastic participation and support. 
The Financial Year 2019-20 (FY20) has 
been a landmark year in the history of 
our Company as it achieved two major 
milestones. Firstly, we transformed 
into a public limited company through 
the successful listing of our Company™s 
shares on the BSE and NSE led by an 
overwhelming response from investors. 
Secondly, our Company has remained 
steadfast in its course of mission and 
continued to report steady performance 
despite the overarching global concerns 
caused by the COVID 19 pandemic, 
humanity™s health and economic crisis. 
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to inflict 
high and rising human costs worldwide. A 
plethora of significant economic policy 
measures, monetary stimulus and liquidity 
facilities have already been undertaken 
globally. However, the global economy 
is projected to contract sharply by 3% in 
CY2020, more severe than that of the FY 
2009 financial crisis. In the midst of this 
turmoil, the International Monetary Fund™s 
(IMF) projection of 1.9% GDP growth for 
India in 2020 is highest among G20 nations, 
which augurs well for our country as we 
progress into the new fiscal and beyond. 
The RBI has also taken a proactive stance 
in implementing additional measures to 
ensure a conducive financial environment 
and to facilitate greater normalcy in the 
functioning of financial markets.
The Indian plastic pipes and fittings 
industry has been witnessing healthy 
growth over the last couple of years. The 
industry growth outlook remains strong 
driven by the Government of India™s focus 
on expanding areas under irrigation 
and increasing urban infrastructure 
spending which determines demand for 
Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS) and 
affordable housing projects in urban, semi 
urban and rural areas. Various schemes 
and initiatives like, Pradhan Mantri Krishi 
Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) , Smart City 
projects, Housing for All by 2022 etc. 
will provide stronger impetus to industry 
growth. This in turn will be further aided 
by the growing penetration of branded 
plumbing pipes in the affordable housing 
project segment and need-based 
replacement potential of plumbing pipes. 
The plastic piping industry is expected to 
grow at a healthy pace over FY19-FY24 to 
reach ~INR 500 billion by FY24.
I must say, that I feel great pride as I witness 
the growth of Prince Pipes and Fittings 
Limited. Your Company was incepted in 
1987 and over 3 decades the journey has 
been extremely rewarding. From humble 
beginnings to emerging as one of India™s 
largest integrated piping solutions & multi 
polymer manufacturers. It continues to 
be an exciting adventure that has today 
culminated into a larger mission of creating 
innovations in plumbing, irrigation, storage 
and sewerage technologies to meet India™s 
growing water management needs.
Today, your Company is one of India™s 
largest PVC pipes manufacturer engaged 
in the manufacturing of polymer pipes 
and fittings through production of polymer 
pipes - CPVC, UPVC, HDPE, PPR and fittings 
- CPVC, PPR, and UPVC. The leading brands 
are Prince Piping Systems and Trubore. 
In June 2020 your Company through a 
pilot launch, introduced in Gujarat a new 
water tank segment-STOREFIT to be later 
launched in other markets across India.  
It gives me great pride that today your 
Company is a front runner in leading 
a significant transformation in India™s 
exponentially increasing water demands. 
We have developed expansive operations 
across agriculture, plumbing, borewell 
categories, built the widest sewage product 
range and underground drainage solutions. 
We have built a strong distribution network 
with over 7,167 SKUs. Driven by intense 
industry expertise accumulated over 
3 decades, Prince Pipes has striven to 
cultivate an innovative mind-set to resolve 
various water related challenges.
7
We are poised to deliver exponential value for our customers & 
investors as we resolutely build on our 3 decades-long legacy 
to become India™s biggest Piping Solutions manufacturer with 
our multi-location manufacturing plants, pan-India distribution 
network, diversified product portfolio, strong brand equity & 
sound cash management 
With the success of its IPO, I firmly 
believe that your Company is now at the 
threshold of its next phase of growth. Its 
value proposition is extremely strong 
and differentiated; its brand is firmly 
entrenched in consumer minds; and 
growth strategy is clear. Product innovation 
and further expansion of geographical 
footprint will continue to take centre stage. 
Your Company will continue to enhance 
and strengthen its manufacturing units 
and judiciously leverage branding and 
advertising to amplify brand connect with 
a larger consumer base.
In addition to the five strategically located 
state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities, 
your Company commenced production 
at it™s sixth newly constructed plant at 
Jaipur, Rajasthan in September™19, while an  
integrated plant at Telangana is also in the 
process of being established, which will 
reinforce the Company™s presence in South 
India. We will also continue to bolster 
our presence in Eastern India through 
an asset light model by outsourcing the 
manufacture of high-volume low value 
PVC pipes. Such initiatives will help us to 
reduce freight cost and strengthen our 
market share.
Your Company will have twin benefits as 
capacity additions coincide with market 
consolidation. Such market consolidation is 
due to imposition of high anti-dumping duty 
on imported CPVC resin from China/Korea, 
weak balance sheet of few companies 
having significant regional presence and 
some fringe national players. Additionally, 
the current environment marked with the 
NBFC financial stress, sluggish demand, 
GST implementation and strong focus on 
stringent quality norms, are other factors 
that will lead to industry consolidation. 
On the face of a continuing global pandemic, 
your Company achieved significant growth 
in FY20 as compared to the previous 
year FY19. During the year under review, 
we continued to implement our strategy 
of adding greater capacities, expanding 
our network as well as optimising our 
product mix towards high value-added 
margin products. The Company reported 
consolidated revenue growth by 4.1% to 
` 
16,356.57 million, the EBITDA grew by 
24.3% to 
`
2,287.79 million and EBITDA 
margin stood at 14.0% in FY20. Profit 
After Tax increased by 37.0% to reach 
 
Rs 1,125.07 million in FY20. The Company 
aimed to utilise IPO proceeds for adding 
and upgrading facilities as well as towards 
repayment of debt, which has led the 
Company to be in a net cash position.  Our 
debt-to-equity ratio, has hence improved 
from 0.74 times to 0.31 times in FY20.
With a strong legacy, pan-India presence, 
diversified product portfolio across 
applications, capacity additions, wide 
distribution network, brand equity, and 
healthy financial position, your Company 
is well positioned to further strengthen 
its leadership position in the Indian plastic 
pipes and fittings industry. 
Corporate governance, ethics and integrity 
have always been our moral compass. 
These values will never be compromised 
as we adhere to the highest levels of 
compliance and regulatory disclosures. 
In the midst of a challenging and rapidly 
changing business environment, your 
Company is committed to work with 
innovative zeal, enhance stakeholders™ 
value and enrich our bonds with employees 
and business partners.
I would like to express my appreciation 
to every Board member for their valuable 
contribution and the entire management 
team for their commitment and passion 
that have enabled us to keep up pace and 
profits consistently.
In conclusion, I would like to thank all 
our stakeholders including our vendors, 
customers, bankers, financial institutions, 
Central and State government bodies, 
dealers, business associates and our 
employees for consistent cooperation and 
strong faith.
We look forward to your continued support 
to reach new milestones. 
Sincerely,
Mr. Jayant Chheda

Economy Overview
Global Economy
The Global economy was already in a precarious place in early 
2019, but was stabilizing until the Covid-19 hit. In 2020, the risk of 
global recession is extremely high as the outbreak of the Novel 
Coronavirus (Covid-19) would have a triple-whammy impact on 
the global economy. The pandemic has triggered  major supply-
chain disruptions due to containment attempts in China and other 
economies across a number of industries; severe demand shocks 
across discretionary spend categories as well as domestic 
lockdowns and increasing government spending towards relief 
measures might lead to  financial crisis. The adverse economic 
impact would push the global economy toward recession as IMF 
in its April 2020 outlook, projected the world economy to contract 
by 3% in 2020, surpassing that seen during the global financial 
crisis in 2009. However a partial recovery is expected in 2021 
with considerable uncertainty about the strength of the rebound. 
Indian Economy
India is projected to be the third largest consumer economy, as its 
consumption is expected to triple to US$ 5 trillion by 2025. India 
is likely to gain upper-middle-income status behind a rapidly 
growing middle class with higher spending power, digitization, 
globalization, favourable demographics and Government reforms 
and initiatives. The Indian economy is not totally insulated from 
global economic shocks. The key reasons for this are the spread 
of COVID-19 and the subsequent national lockdown that has 
enforced crippling of most economic and commercial activities. As 
a result, according to IMF, India™s real GDP growth rate is expected 
to move from 4.2% in 2019 to 1.9% in 2020. However, unlike other 
markets, India has the potential to bounce back much faster and  
be on track to have a USD 5 trillion economy by 2025. Eventually, 
the containment and duration of domestic lockdown, the extent of 
global slump, and domestic policy support to recovery will decide 
the shape of economic recovery.

The Inflation measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), 
remained below target for 13 consecutive months until Q2:2019-
20. It exceeded the upper tolerance ceiling of 6% by December 
2019 and peaked at 7.6% by January  2020 before being 
moderated to 5.9% by March 2020. The PMI for manufacturing 
fell to 51.8 in March 2020 from a peak of 54.5 in February 
2020 as the output and new orders rose at a softer pace, with 
exports falling the most since September 2013 amid widespread 
lockdowns due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, to combat 
the current situation, RBI is constantly taking various steps 
to inject large liquidity into the system through open market 
transactions and reducing cash reserve ratios, reverse repo 
rate, providing three months moratorium on loan etc. ensuring 
stability in the financial markets.
Industry Overview
Indian Plastic Pipe and Fittings Market
The growth in Indian plastic pipes and fittings industry is driven 
by investments in the agriculture and construction space, namely 
irrigation, water supply and sanitation (WSS), as well as in 
housing. Investments in these industries are closely linked to the 
Indian GDP growth.  The size of Indian plastic pipes and fittings 
industry was estimated at 
` 
290-300 bn in FY19. The industry 
rose at a healthy 10%-12% CAGR between FY14 and FY19 driven 
by rising demand from the construction and irrigation sectors. 
This was further aided by increased awareness, adoption and 
substitution of metal pipes by plastic pipes due to their lower 
price, higher longevity, relative resistance to leakage, and easy 
installation. The organised segment in the pipes and fittings 
industry accounts for a 60-65% share of the country™s plastic 
pipes industry.
 
The industry is expected to reach 
` 
500 bn by FY24 registering a 
CAGR of 12- 14% over FY19-FY24.

Growth drivers for the sector
 
Irrigation
The irrigation sector is the biggest end-user segment for plastic 
pipes, accounting for 45-50% share of the industry. Roughly 
50% of arable land is still not irrigated and 63% of irrigated 
land is dependent on tube wells, which are at the mercy of the 
monsoons. This provides a multi-year opportunity for agri pipes 
in India. Thus, the Government of India (GoI) has increased its 
focus on improving irrigation coverage area, which is expected 
to drive demand for PVC plastic pipes over the medium-to-long 
term.
GoI has also launched a flagship programme, ﬁPradhan Mantri 
Krishi Sinchai Yojanaﬂ with an outlay of 
`
 500 bn over FY16 to 
FY20 with an objective of enhancing the area under cultivation. 
Formulated with the vision of increasing irrigation coverage and 
improving water efficiency, its ‚Per Drop More Crop™ initiative 
focuses on micro irrigation systems (sprinkler, drip, pivots, rain-
guns etc.) to promote precision farming by making water easily 
available.  To support the programme, the GoI has approved 
a corpus of 
`
 50 bn for setting up a dedicated ﬁMicro Irrigation 
Fundﬂ with NABARD. 
The GoI has created two basic dedicated funds Œ a long term 
irrigation fund and a micro irrigation fund with an initial outlay of 
`
450 billion for financing these projects.
At present, the irrigation sector has 182 projects in its pipeline 
with an investment outlay of more than 
`
7 trillion based on the 
projects tracked by India Infrastructure Research in 2019
Overall irrigation investments are expected to be around 
` 
6,400 
bn over FY19-FY24 as compared to approximately 
` 
3,900 bn 
over the past five years (FY14-FY19). Nearly 75% of the total 
investment in irrigation is expected to be towards construction, 
which will provide support to the pipes and fittings industry. 
During the period FY14-FY19, 75% of irrigation investments 
were made in top seven states - Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, 
Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar 
Pradesh whose average achievement ratio stood at 95% in the 
past few years. Recently, other states like Odisha, Rajasthan 
and Chhattisgarh have significantly increased their allocations 
towards irrigation.

Water supply and sanitation (WSS) and plumbing 
WSS and plumbing are the second largest end-user segments 
for plastic pipes, accounting for 35-40% share of the plastic 
pipes market. Water is an essential resource and the GoI has 
taken initiatives to conserve and reuse it.  Accordingly, the 
Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA) has been launched in 2019 to speed 
up water conservation in the most water stressed blocks and 
districts of India. As per Economic Survey 2019-20, JSA has 
delivered over 3.5 lakh tonnes of water in 256 districts through 
rain water harvesting, rejuvenation of traditional water bodies, 
implementation of water conservation tactics, and watershed 
development projects.
The plastic pipe industry has witnessed a good demand in the past 
five years from the central government™s high spending on urban 
development projects such as Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and 
Urban Transformation (AMRUT); Smart Cities Project etc. AMRUT 
aims at establishing an infrastructure that could ensure adequate 
water supply and robust sewage networks in 500 towns. 
As per Union Budget 2020-21, Central Government has allocated 
` 
16.29 lakh crore for Urban infra which includes AMRUT, SMART 
Cities, Mass Rapid Transit System (MRTS), Affordable Housing, 
Jal Jeevan Mission etc.  Besides, Rs.3.60 Lakh crore has been 
approved for Jal-Jeevan Mission which will be majorly driven 
by the recently proposed ﬁNal se Jalﬂ scheme to achieve the 
objective of improving water level in water stressed districts of 
the country (Source: Union Budget 2020-21)
It is estimated that GoI has invested around 
` 
1,753 bn over FY14-
FY19 in WSS segment. WSS investments are expected to be 
around 
` 
2,924 bn over the next five years, i.e., from FY19-FY24. 
The growth in investment will be driven by the recently proposed 
ﬁNal se Jalﬂ scheme, a component of the Jal Jivan Mission, which 
promises to provide piped drinking water to every household in 
the country by 2024. GoI schemes such as the Swachh Bharat 
Mission and the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) are 
further likely to boost WSS investments.

Real Estate Sector
Real estate is a key end-user sector for plastic pipes and fittings 
in India. Over the last few years, end-user demand for real estate 
has been sluggish. Developers were facing challenges, which 
20
include declining sales, delay in approvals, negative free cash 
flows, stricter regulatory compliance under RERA and slowdown 
in lending from banks and non-bank finance companies. The 
reformative steps brought into the real estate sector over the 
last 2-3 years will enhance transparency along with financial 
discipline and increased efficiency.  The current estimated market 
size of the industry is 
`
120 bn for FY20.  By 2030, the Indian real 
estate industry is expected to touch 
`
650 bn, becoming the third 
largest globally.
Some of the key growth drivers for real estate demand are 
below: - 
 
I
Urbanisation: Rising income and employment opportunities 
have led to growing urbanisation and higher demand for 
affordable housing 
 
I
Traction in tier II and III cities and surging demand from rural 
sector: The healthy growth trajectory is expected in these 
areas. Developers with income generating assets, healthy 
balance sheets and brand recognition are in a better position 
to increase rural penetration.
 
I
Affordable Housing and Housing for All: Backed by several 
Government reforms, growing population and developer 
realignment of product-mix, the focus has now been shifted 
towards affordable housing from luxury and mid segment 
housing. Under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) Œ 
Urban the Government has estimated demand of 1.12 crore 
houses for urban poor. As on January 1, 2020, out of 1.03 
crore houses approved, 60 lakhs have been grounded for 
construction, of which 32 lakh houses have been completed 
and delivered.
 
I
Government Policies and Initiatives: The Government has 
initiated several measures to improve prospects of the Real-
Estate sector. The RERA, Benami Transactions Act, impetus 
for affordable housing construction, reduction of GST rates, 
Interest subsidy and tax saving schemes for home buyers 
are some of the initiatives undertaken by the government 
during the last couple of years.
 
I
Increasing trend of Co-living: Developers are now 
diversifying and exploring new arenas providing solutions 
to niche segments like senior living communities, co-living 
and co-working spaces, student housing options, healthcare 
facilities and other segments like townships and plotted 
developments.

Industry estimates 1.16bn sqft of housing supply under 
execution across select cities (NCR, Mumbai, Bengaluru, 
Pune, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Chandigarh 
and Kochi) will come on stream by CY21.

Substitution and replacement demand with CPVC gaining prominence
Demand growth of CPVC segment over the past five fiscal years (FY14-FY19) has been the highest among pipes, as CPVC pipes in 
India are still at a nascent stage and have huge potential due to competitive advantage such as longevity, being corrosion free, being 
fire resistant, being lead-free, and their ability to withstand high temperatures. Industry expects CPVC is expected to record 20-21% 
CAGR over FY19-FY24E and its revenue share is expected to increase from 15% of the industry in FY19 to above 20% in FY24. Further, 
CPVC segment provides branded players an opportunity to increase their market share given technological barriers for the category 
(currently, all CPVC polymer is imported into India making it difficult for unorganised players). Demand for HDPE pipes will be driven 
by government schemes such as PMKSY (drip and sprinkler irrigation) and WSS projects (large diameter sewerage pipes). Moreover, 
replacement of older pipes with plastic pipes will further increase demand. According to industry estimates, the replacement market 
accounts for roughly 25% of plumbing pipe demand in India.

Consolidation in plastic pipes industry to help organised players: 
Due to the sharp increase in PVC resin prices, NBFC financial crisis, 
sluggish demand environment in FY19,  GST, Demonetisation, 
high custom duty on CPVC resin from China and South Korea and  
BIS Strict implementation of Quality norms various small and 
mid-sized national and regional players are facing  major balance 
sheet constraints. This has pushed many unorganized players out 
of the market, eventually leading to market share gains for large 
players. Further, leading plastic pipe companies are expected to 
gain market shares in near future due to industry consolidation 
largely because of weak balance sheets of few large organized 
players and tight liquidity position of small unorganized players.

PPFL continuously aims at growing and changing its product 
mix to higher margin segments like plumbing and Drainage 
system. The fittings segment typically earns higher margins due 
to the specialised nature and precision required vis-à-vis the 
pipes segment. The Company has added in-house capabilities 
for manufacturing of plumbing ball valves of the running sizes 
at Haridwar plant. Eventually the Company targets to increase 
these capabilities to become an integrated manufacturer of pipes, 
fittings, solvents and now valves as well. This will transform PPFL 
from being a pipe processor into an integrated system as well as 
end-to-end solution provider.
Expand the Trubore brand to New Product lines and New 
States:
Trubore brand is now considered a premium brand and its 
products are currently sold mainly in Tamil Nadu primarily to 
the agriculture segment. PPFL plans to increase the product 
portfolio under the Trubore brand to cater to the building industry 
and infrastructure segment & also start selling this brand in new 
geographies.
Set up a new manufacturing plant in Telangana and 
expand capacity at Jaipur Plant
The Company is all set to introduce a new plant at Sangareddy 
(Telangana) with a total installed estimated capacity of 
51,943MTPA which will be operational by FY22. Currently PPFL 
caters to south market mainly by two plants i.e. Chennai plant and 
Haridwar plant. Opening of new plant in Telangana will help the 
Company to have effective presence in south India market. Our 
Jaipur plant has commenced commercial production in H1 FY20 
and capacity is expanded to 20,909 TPA as on March 31, 2020. 
The plant has been constructed so that its installed capacity can 
be increased to up to 40,621 TPA based on machine availability 
and market demand for the products.

Increase sales of DWC pipes
Double Wall Corrugated (DWC) pipes are pipes with full circular 
dual-wall cross-section, with an outer corrugated pipe wall, 
a smooth inner surface and are used in the sewerage and 
drainage industry. These pipes have been gaining prominence 
over traditional metal and cement pipes, due to durability, low 
maintenance and longevity PPFL has invested about 
` 
400 
million to set up capacity of 36,624 TPA which is spread across 
Chennai, Dadra and Haridwar plants and is one of the highest in 
the industry. Additionally, the Company has contracted for 5,544 
TPA in Aurangabad (Maharashtra) for western region. In FY20, the 
Company has received a patent for innovative and technologically 
superior product design of the DWC Coupler. Being the first mover 
with the wide range of DWC products, PPFL has demonstrated its 
strategy of providing wide product range and the product designs 
as a brands differentiator. The Company plans to leverage its 
multi-location manufacturing network to become the first one to 
manufacture DWC at all its plants across the country. This will 
significantly help the Company with the competitive advantage 
and to demonstrate its execution capabilities.
Brand building and marketing strategy
PPFL™s both the brands Prince Piping Systems and Trubore 
enjoys strong loyalty from distributors and consumers. This 
has enabled the Company to augment its brands aggressively 
through various ways such as customer loyalty program, Below 
the Line (BTL) promotions, above the line (ATL) promotions and 
social media engagements. The Company appointed Mr. Akshay 
Kumar (Bollywood actor) as a brand ambassador in 2018 in order 
to enhance brand equity further on homeowners, plumbers, 
farmers and to foray into B2C segment. Apart from usual 
hoardings and shop boards, PPFL used two unique mediums for 
brand play Œ ﬁWinning in Many Indiasﬂ. Firstly, the Company used 
multi-state single strategy of transit media to build the brand. 
This includes the most popular regional mode of transport for 
example, the Delhi metro, Mumbai local train, and buses in South 
India etc. Secondly, PPFL has created a film co-branding strategy 
with Akshay Kumar™s film ‚Mission Mangal™ in FY20.
The Company™s online and social media marketing strategy for 
the next five years is to popularize its brands by increasing digital 
footprint, such as by developing separate websites for Prince 
Piping Systems and Trubore brands. As a part of marketing 
strategy, PPFL aims to increase its presence across popular social 
media platforms by focusing on cost effective mediums such as 
digital and mobile solutions like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and 
various e-commerce B2B portals.
PPFL also conducts Parivaar and Mitra Meets which includes 
dealers meet, plumber meets etc. to build confidence, influence 
community, resolve issues or queries and introduce new products 
with their features, benefits and applications.
Improving cost-efficiency
In order to reduce the operational cost and achieve a sustainable 
goal, PPFL is planning to utilise renewable energy sources at 
multiple factories. At Chennai Plant, the Company has already 
started connecting wind energy and will soon start harnessing 
solar power through the opex model. On completion, almost 25% 
of Chennai plant will be running through the renewable energy 
and will lead to savings on conversion cost. The Company is 
further planning to harness the solar power at Haridwar, Jaipur, 
Dadra and other plants in a phased manner.
IPO to meet funding requirement
In December 2019, PPFL raised 
` 
5,000 million via initial public 
offering (IPO) comprising of 
` 
2,500 million through a fresh issue 
of 14.04 million equity shares at an offer price of 
`
 178 per share 
and another 
` 
2,500 million through an offer for sale of 14.04 
million equity shares by existing shareholders. Pursuant to the 
IPO, the equity shares of the Company have got listed on BSE 
limited and National stock exchange of India limited on December 
30, 2019. The IPO proceeds are intended to be used  for setting 
up the plant at Telangana, upgradation of equipment at our 
manufacturing facilities and also for repayment of the debt.

Channel financing
In order to enhance the sales of our products, we provide channel 
financing facility to our distributors which is a flexible mode of 
financing working capital requirements.  Our Channel Financing 
24
facility helps the channel partners or key distributors to get an 
access to working capital financing at better rate, which helps 
them take up large projects that otherwise would have been 
unable to execute due to working capital constraints. The facility 
is provided by the bank to the channel partners based on the 
strength of their business relationship with our Company. 
Risk and Mitigation
Economy risk
 : The plastic pipes industry derives the majority 
of its demand from plumbing, irrigation, water transportation 
and sewerage applications, which in turn depends on the level 
of activity in residential, non-residential construction, agriculture 
and industrial spaces. Any Industry slowdown will impact PPFL™s 
financial performance adversely. 
Mitigation measures
 : The performance of these industries 
and consequently the demand for PPFL™s products in these 
segments, are dependent on economic and other factors such 
as government policies, regulations and budgetary allocations 
as well as investments made in these industries and segments. 
However, the increasing government expenditure and investment 
towards housing and sanitation, building and construction, 
irrigation, and environmental protection activities through various 
schemes such as housing for all and making 100 smart cities etc. 
will provide immense opportunities for India PVC pipes market 
players and specially the organised player like PPFL to maintain 
sustainable growth in future.
Input risk:
 
UPVC, CPVC, PPR and HPDE resins are the key 
raw materials used in the production, whose prices are largely 
dependent on crude oil price movement. Increase in price of raw 
materials may affect the profitability of the Company. 
Mitigation measures:
 PPFL has the ability to pass on the 
increased cost to the customer in the form of increased prices 
of our products. In addition the Company™s purchasing teams 
work in close coordination with suppliers to avail discounts for 
reducing the purchasing cost.
Competition risk:
 
PPFL sells its products in highly competitive 
markets. The Company might receive high competition from its 
peers.
Mitigation measures:
 In order to remain competitive, the 
Company continuously strives to reduce its costs of production, 
transportation and distribution, and improve its operating 
efficiencies. The Company is poised to have significant competitive 
advantage due to its strategically located manufacturing facilities, 
wide distribution network, diversified range of products and 
ability to provide comprehensive plumbing, irrigation and SWR 
management solutions to the customers.
Operating risk:
 
Operational efficiency forms the key factor for 
the profitability and sustainable growth for the Company and it 
also determines the company™s competitiveness against other 
players in the region.
Mitigation measures:
 The Company has put together an apt 
combination of people, processes and technology to optimize the 
business performance that leads to higher sustainable growth. 
Company™s revenue from operations is affected by the number 
of new SKUs. PPFL has a product development team, which is 
responsible for introducing new products and variations of 
existing products. The team regularly interacts with the plumbing 
consultants and contractors to understand the demand for new 
products and variations in existing products
Foreign exchange risk:
 
The Company imports some of the raw 
material and equipment/machinery utilized in manufacturing 
plants. Any unfavourable movements in the exchange rate 
would adversely affect the Company™s financials and results of 
operations.
Mitigation measures:
 PPFL evaluates exchange rate exposure 
arising from foreign currency transactions on a continuous basis. 
To hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk the Company 
enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments like 
foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and 
cross currency swaps. 
Credit risk:
 The majority of the sales are to distributors on an 
open credit basis with standard payment period between 15-30 
days. If Company is unable to collect receivables, it could have an 
adverse effect on the company™s performance and its business of 
operations.
Mitigation measures:
 
The risk is partly mitigated as the 
Company generally purchases raw materials from domestic 
suppliers on credit terms of less than a week and purchase 
imported raw materials on credit terms of 90-150 days. However, 
the standard payment term with distributors is generally between 
15-30 days. The Company uses working capital facilities to fund 
the timing difference between the payment for raw materials and 
the receipt of payment for manufactured products. In addition, 
the Company also use channel financing to optimise the working 
capital requirements and improve collections/debtor days.
Regulatory risk:
 The Indian government has imposed an anti-
dumping duty (ADD) on CPVC resin/compound imports from 
China and Korea for a period of five years (valid up to February 
2025). This move is followed by provisional anti-dumping duty 
announced on 26th August 2019. Industry™s share of imports 
from China & South Korea stood at about 33% of the total imports 
between April-August 2019. 
Mitigation measures:
 PPFL were sourcing CPVC resin from 
multiple sources including Korea, Japan, China and Europe.  The 
Company has now stopped purchasing CPVC resin from Korea 
and China. Sourcing from other vendors lead to an increase in 
cost. However, being amongst the top players, the impact is 
25
expected to be limited for PPFL as it will be able to pass on the 
increased cost to the customers in line with other market players.
Corporate Social Responsibility
PPFL committed constant innovations in plumbing, irrigation and 
sewerage technologies to meet the nation™s constantly increasing 
water demands. The Company constantly strives to pave the 
way for a future that provides clean water for everyone and 
everywhere from the smallest villages to the largest cities.  The 
Company has Corporate Social Responsibility (ﬁCSRﬂ) Committee

monitoring the real time and the live data. The Company has 
also adopted automation in non-core processes like pipe lifting 
and product packaging to further optimise the cost. All of these 
initiatives will not only act as a cost optimizer but also help PPFL 
to be a preferred brand.

finished goods to its channel partners and gradually scaling up 
the utilization of manufacturing facilities across the nation. The 
necessary precautions and safety measures are put in place to 
maintain social distancing.

The Company™s philosophy on each principle is reproduced 
below:
Principle 1: Businesses should conduct and govern themselves 
with Ethics, Transparency and Accountability
We believe that for a successful and sustainable business, a strong 
foundation of ethical corporate citizenship and establishment of 
good corporate culture is essential. We are committed to operate 
our business ethically in a manner such that all stakeholders i.e. 
investors, creditors, distributors, customers, employees, and even 
competitors, the government and the society at large, are dealt 
with in a fair manner. We have always believed in adhering to the 
best governance practices to ensure protection of interests of all 
stakeholders of the Company in tandem with healthy growth of

internal code of conduct and business ethics which every 
employee needs to abide by. We ensure that genuine concerns of 
misconduct/ unlawful conduct can be reported in a responsible 
and confidential manner through the Company™s Vigil Mechanism. 
We also encourage our business partners and third parties with 
whom we conduct business to abide by this policy.
Further, the Company also encourages transparency of operations 
by ensuring that the statutory disclosures are governed by 
the Code of Practices and Procedures for Fair Disclosure of 
Unpublished Price Sensitive Information, Determination of 
Materiality Policy, etc. The Company also regularly publishes 
necessary disclosures, investor presentations and important

stakeholders of the operating risks and strives to redress the 
issues raised as promptly as possible, being accountable for its 
actions.

business dealings and it believes in free and open competition 
and does not encourage any anti-competitive or unfair practice. 
Principle 2: Businesses should provide goods and services that 
are safe and contribute to sustainability throughout their life 
cycle
We believe that sustainable development meets the needs of the 
present, without compromising the ability of future generations 
to meet their own needs. The Company endeavours to implement 
the principles of sustainability into the various stages of product or 
service lifecycle, including procurement of raw material/ service, 
manufacturing products or delivery of service, transportation of 
raw materials and finished goods, and disposal by consumers. 
We strive to ensure that the exploitation of resources, direction 
of investments, orientation of technological development and 
institutional change are in harmony and enhance both current 
and future potential to meet the human needs and aspirations.

1.
 
List up to 3 of your products or services whose design has 
incorporated social or environmental concerns, risks and/
or opportunities.
a.
 
Vent Cowl PVC Jalli 110mm - SWR (Vent cowl integrated 
jalli)
91
 
This product has been developed as a plastic injection 
moulded vent cowl with inbuilt jalli (net). The vent cowl 
is used in houses and offices for ventilation purposes 
to allow foul gases generated in the system to escape. 
Vent cowls are also designed to fit the top of toilet vent 
pipes, to reduce pan syphoning. 
 
This enables the effective discharge of polluted air 
outside the building. The inbuilt net prevents mosquitos 
from entering the house through wastewater line and 
relatedly prevents diseases like Malaria, Dengue, 
Chikungunya, etc. caused by Mosquito bites.
b.
 
Hands Free Sanitizing Unit (2 models - Eco Compact 
and Eco Heavy) 
 
In wake of the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, 
hands free sanitizing unit has been developed by 
the Company. This product is used to dispense hand 
sanitizer/ hand wash by using one™s foot, without 
touching the bottle/ unit in order to prevent the spread 
of Corona virus infection. We have also installed such 
sanitizing units at various government and other public 
service offices.
c.
 
Double Wall Corrugated (‚DWC™) pipes from 100mm to 
1000mm 
 
In line with demand for newer products for various 
applications, we have developed Double Walled Pipes 
using High Density Polyethylene. This pipe has been 
developed to replace the age-old Reinforced Concrete 
Cement pipes. DWC pipes are used in underground 
sewerage systems in municipalities and households. 
The internal surface helps in smooth flow of sewerage. 
Due to its flexibility, DWC pipes allow deformation in 
diameter as well as in joints under external load and 
soil™s natural movement and hence operate years after 
years without affecting the environment unlike the 
concrete pipes which get easily damaged, leading to 
sewer water leaching in the ground and harming the 
environment. DWC pipes are environment safe and 
have a long service life, are easy to install and maintain, 
and hence are cost-effective and sustainable. 
 
The Company is committed to offer quality standards 
for all range of products which are safe and 
environment friendly. The Company has well equipped 
test labs in all locations to verify the product quality on 
a regular basis to ensure that there is no deviation from 
standards. Some of the products are also tested in 
international labs to verify the values against declared 
standards. The Company ensures that all its products 
meet hygiene, durability as per the application 
requirement and functional requirements. As a policy, 
the Company refrains from using any degraded/ post-
consumer waste material for its products. 
 
As a one of the leading plastic processor and producer 
of diversified finished products, the Company has 
entered into technical collaborations for its product line 
and has testing labs and quality facilities at its plants 
to regularly carry out different test work on products 
at various stages of production process to ensure that 
required standards and efficiencies are maintained. 
 
The Company also encourages and conducts factory 
visits to inculcate complete knowledge on various 
products of the Company. At such visits, we showcase 
our product and hands on demo section including 
advance testing laboratories and classroom trainings 
for familiarizing with safety standards to the visiting 
farmers, customers, plumbers, architects, contractors, 
engineers etc. The Company imparts extensive 
trainings to the influencers viz. the plumbers, plumbing 
contractors, architects, engineers, consultants, 
farmers etc. Beside awareness on various products 
manufactured by the Company and its end applications, 
this educates people more about plastic piping 
products and its advantages over the conventional 
materials. 
 
Our products incorporate social and environmental 
concerns. The Company has also introduced 
underground water storage tanks, double wall 
corrugated pipes for underground sewage and 
drainage which are the testimony of the Company™s 
philosophy of providing safe and sustainable products 
throughout their life cycle. 
2.
 
For each such product, provide the following details in 
respect of resource use (energy, water, raw material 
etc.) per unit of product (optional):
a)
 
Reduction during sourcing/ production/ distribution 
achieved since the previous year throughout the value 
chain?
 
Our drive for continuous improvement and innovation 
has enabled us to reduce process waste, lower energy 
consumption, increase productivity and release 
new products, thereby achieving higher customer 
acceptance and satisfaction.  
 
 
The Company uses state-of-the-art technology 
for machines and equipment used for production

Description of Key Audit Matters:
Key Audit Matters
How the matter was addressed in our audit
Provision for Discount & Incentives
  Revenue is measured net of discounts, incentives and rebates 
given to the customers on the Company™s sales.
  The Company™s presence across different marketing regions 
within the country and the competitive business environment 
makes the assessment of various type of discounts and 
incentives as complex and judgmental.
 Given the complexity and judgement required to assess the 
provision for discounts and incentives, this is a key audit matter.
Our audit procedures included:
  We have assessed the Company™s accounting policies relating 
to revenue, discounts,  incentives and rebates by comparing 
with applicable Ind AS. 
  We have assessed the Company™s computations for accrual of 
discounts, incentives and rebates.
 On a sample basis, checked the accruals made with the 
approved schemes and underlying documents.
 We have compared the historical trend of discounts and 
incentives to provisions made to assess the current year 
accruals.

Other Information
The Company™s Management and Board of Director are 
responsible for the other information. The Other information 
comprises the information included in the company™s annual 
report, but does not include the financial statements and our 
auditor™s report thereon. The other information is expected to be 
made available to us after the date of this auditor™s report.
 
 
  
Our Opinion on the accompanying Ind AS financial statements 
does not cover the other information and we do not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the accompanying Ind AS financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, 
in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with accompanying Ind AS financial statements or 
our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated.
When we read the other information included in the Company™s 
annual report, if we concluded that there is a material 
misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter 
to those charged with governance. 
Management™s Responsibility for the Ind AS Financial 
Statements 
The Company™s Management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with 
respect to the preparation of these Ind AS financial statements 
that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs, profit and other 
comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the 
Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (ﬁInd 
ASﬂ) prescribed under Section 133 of the Act. This responsibility 
also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in 
accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds 
and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate 
accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate  internal financial  controls that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness 
of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and 
presentation of the Ind AS financial statements that give a true 
and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error.
In preparing the Ind AS financial statements, management and 
Board of Director are responsible for assessing the Company™s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless management either intends to 
liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
The Company™s Management and Board of Directors are also 
responsible for overseeing the Company™s financial reporting 
process.
Auditor™s Responsibility for the Audit of the Ind AS Financial 
Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the Ind AS financial statements as whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an 
auditor™s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Ind AS 
Financial Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also: 
1.
 
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of 
the Ind AS financial statements, whether due to fraud or 
error, design and perform audit procedures responsive 
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk 
of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud 
may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 
2.
 
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)
(i) of the Companies Act, 2013, we are also responsible 
for expressing our opinion on whether the company has 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to Ind AS 
financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness 
of such controls. 
3.
 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by Management and Board of Directors. 
4.
 
Conclude on the appropriateness of Management and Board 
of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting 
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a 
101
material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions 
that may cast significant doubt on the Company™s ability to 
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material 
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our 
auditor™s report to the related disclosures in the Ind AS 
financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, 
to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor™s 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause the 
Company to cease to continue as a going concern. 
5.
 
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of 
the Ind AS financial statements, including the disclosures, 
and whether the Ind AS financial statements represent 
the underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation. 
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, 
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the 
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant 
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement 
that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all 
relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought 
to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related 
safeguards. 
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the Ind AS financial statements of 
the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We 
describe these matters in our auditor™s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter 
should not be communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to 
outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

We have audited the internal financial controls with reference 
to Ind AS financial statements of the Prince Pipes and Fittings 
Limited (ﬁthe Companyﬂ) as at March 31, 2020 in conjunction with 
our audit of the Ind AS financial statements of the Company for 
the year ended on that date. 
Management™s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The Company™s management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial 
controls based on the internal control over financial reporting 
criteria established by the Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on 
Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountant of India (ﬁICAIﬂ). 
These responsibilities include the design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient 
conduct of its business, including adherence to the Company™s 
policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and 
detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness 
of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable 
financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013 
(ﬁthe Actﬂ).
Auditors™ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company™s 
internal financial controls with reference to Ind AS financial 
Statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in 
accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial 
Controls over Financial Reporting (ﬁthe Guidance Noteﬂ) and 
the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under section 143(10) of 
the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial 
controls with reference to Ind AS financial statements. Those 
Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with 
ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial 
controls with reference to Ind AS financial Statements were 
established and maintained and whether  such controls operated 
effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence 
about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system with 
reference to Ind AS financial statements and their operating 
effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with 
reference to Ind AS financial statements included obtaining an 
understanding of such internal financial controls, assessing the 
risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating 
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based 
on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the 
auditor™s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the Ind AS financial statements, whether 
due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the 
Company™s internal financial controls with reference to Ind AS 
financial statements. 
 
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Ind AS 
financial statements
A Company™s internal financial control with reference to Ind AS 
financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the 
preparation of Ind AS financial statements for external purposes 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A 
Company™s internal financial control with reference to Ind AS 
financial statements include those policies and procedures that:
(a)
 
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable 
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the Company;
(b)
 
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are 
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of Ind AS 
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures 
of the Company are being made only in accordance 
with authorisations of management and directors of the 
Company; and
(c)
 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention 
or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the Company™s assets that could have a 
material effect on the Ind AS financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference 
to Ind AS financial statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial with 
reference to Ind AS financial statements, including the possibility 
of collusion or improper management override of controls, 
material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not 
be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal 
financial controls with reference to Ind AS financial statements 
to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial 
control with reference to Ind AS financial statements may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree 
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

2. 
 
Significant Accounting Policies:
            
(a)
 
Statement of Compliance:
       
    
 
The financial statements of the Company are prepared 
in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind 
AS) notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015 as amended by the Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standards) (Amendment) Rules, 2016, 
the relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 (ﬁthe 
Act™™).
 
Except for the changes below, the Company has consistently 
applied accounting policies to all the periods.
i) 
 
The Company has adopted IND AS 116 ‚Leases™ with the 
date of initial application being April 1, 2019. IND AS 116 
replaces IND AS 17 - Leases and related interpretation 
and guidance. The standard sets out principles for 
recognition,measurement,presentation and disclosure 
of leases. 
 
IND AS 116 requires a lessee to recognise assets 
and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 
12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low 
value. The Company has applied IND AS 116 using 
the modified retrospective approach under which the 
cumulative effect is recognised in retained earnings at 
April 1, 2019. As a result, the comparative information 
has not been restated.
 
The financial statements are authorized for issue by 
the Board of Directors of the Company at their meeting 
held on June 25, 2020.
   
        
(b)
 
Basis of Preparation and Presentation:
 
          
 
Basis of Preparation:
        
   
 
The financial statements have been prepared on the 
historical cost basis except for  following assets and 
liabilities:
(i)   
 
Derivative Financial Instruments measured at fair 
value.
(ii)  
 
Certain financial assets and liabilities measured at 
fair value (refer accounting policy regarding financial 
instruments).
(iii) 
 
Employee™s Defined Benefit Plan as per actuarial 
valuation.
 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an 
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date, 
regardless of whether that price is directly observable or 
estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating 
the fair value of an asset or liability, the Company takes into 
account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market 
participants would take those characteristic into account 
when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. 
           
 
 
Functional and Presentation Currency:
     
      
 
The financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees, 
which is the functional currency of the Company and 
currency of primary economic environment in which 
company operates.
           
 
Operating Cycle :
         
  
 
The Company has ascertained its operating cycle as 
twelve months for the purpose of Current / Non-Current 
classification of its Assets and Liabilities.
 
An asset is treated as current when it is:
(i)   
 
Expected to be realized or intended to be sold or 
consumed in normal operating cycle;
(ii)  
 
Held primarily for the purpose of trading, or
(iii) 
 
Expected to be realized within twelve months after the 
reporting period, or
(iv) 
 
Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being 
exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least 
twelve months after the reporting period 
 
116
All other assets are classified as non-current. 
A liability is current when:
(i)  
 
It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle;
(ii) 
 
It is held primarily for the purpose of trading.
(iii) 
 
It is due to be settled within twelve months after the 
reporting period, or
(iv) 
 
There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement 
of the liability for at least twelve months after the 
reporting period. Terms of liability that could result 
in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments 
at the option of the counterparty does not affect this 
classification. 
 
All other liabilities are classified as non-current. 
  
          
(c)
 
Property, plant and equipment (PPE) :
 
          
 
The initial cost of PPE comprises its purchase price, 
including import duties and non-refundable purchase 
taxes, and any directly attributable costs of bringing an 
asset to working condition and location for its intended use, 
including relevant borrowing costs and any expected costs 
of decommissioning. Subsequent expenditures related to an 
item of Property, plant and equipment are added to its book 
value only if they meet the definition of PPE as specified in 
Ind AS 16 Œ Property, Plant and Equipment.
 
Expenditure/ Income during construction period (including 
financing cost related to borrowed funds for construction or 
acquisition of qualifying PPE) is included under Capital Work-
in-Progress, and the same is allocated to the respective PPE 
on the completion of their construction. Advances given 
towards acquisition or construction of PPE outstanding at 
each reporting date are disclosed as Capital Advances under 
ﬁOther non-current Assetsﬂ.
 
Material items such as spare parts, stand-by equipment and 
service equipment are classified as PPE when they meet the 
definition of PPE as specified in Ind AS 16 Œ Property, Plant 
and Equipment.
 
If significant part of an item of PPE have different useful life, 
then they are accounted for as separate items of PPE.
  
         
(d)
 
Depreciation:
          
 
 
Depreciable amount for PPE is the cost of an PPE less its 
estimated residual value. Depreciation on PPE are charged 
based on straight line method on an estimated useful life as 
prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 or as 
per technical assessment.
 
Depreciation on items of property, plant and equipment 
acquired / disposed off during the year is provided on pro-
rata basis with reference to the date of addition / disposal.
 
In certain classes of PPE, the Company uses different useful 
lives than those prescribed in Schedule II to the Act. The 
useful lives have been assessed based on technical advice, 
taking into account the nature of the PPE and the estimated 
usage of the PPE on the management™s estimation of 
obtaining economic benefits from those classes of assets.

Intangible assets :
 
          
 
Intangible assets acquired separately
     
      
 
Intangible assets that are acquired separately with 
finite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment, if any. The 
Company determines the amortisation period as the period 
over which the future economic benefits will flow to the 
Company after taking into account all relevant facts and 
circumstances. The estimated useful life and amortisation 
method are reviewed periodically, with the effect of any 
changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective 
basis. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not 
amortized, but are tested for impairment annually, either 
individually or at the cash-generating unit level
           
 
Derecognition of intangible assets
      
     
 
An intangible asset is derecognized on disposal, or when no 
future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. 
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible 
asset are recognized in the statement of profit and loss 
when the asset is derecognized.
           
 
Internally generated Intangible assets (Research and 
Development expenditure)
       
  
 
Expenditure pertaining to research is expensed as incurred. 
Expenditure incurred on development is capitalised if such 
expenditure leads to creation of an asset, otherwise such 
expenditure is charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss.

Impairment of Non-Financial Assets :
           
 
At the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews 
the carrying amounts of non-financial assets to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets have 
suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, 
the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in 
order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if 
any). When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable 
amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which 
the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis 
of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also 
allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise 
they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating 
units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis 
can be identified.
 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs 
of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present 
value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future 
cash flows have not been adjusted.
 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating 
unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the 
carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is 
reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is 
recognised immediately in Statement of Profit and Loss, 
unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in 
which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation 
decrease.
 
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the 
carrying amount of the asset (or a cash-generating unit) is 
increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, 
but to the extent that the increased carrying amount does 
not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for 
the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal 
of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss, unless the relevant asset is 
carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of 
the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
  
           
(g)
 
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held 
for disposal :
 
          
 
Non-current assets are classified as held for disposal if their 
carrying amount will be recovered principally through a 
sale transaction rather than through continuing use.  Such 
assets are measured at lower of their carrying amount and 
fair value less costs to sell
 
To classify any  asset as  ﬁﬂAsset held for disposalﬂﬂ the asset 
must be available for immediate sale in its present condition 
subject only to terms that are usual and customary for 
sales of such assets and its sale is highly probable. Also, 
Management must be committed to the sale, which should 
be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale 
within a year from the date of classification. Once classified 
as held for disposal, intangible assets and PPE are no longer 
amortised or depreciated.

Inventories :
 
         
 
Raw materials, fuel, stores & spare parts and packing 
materials:
 
Valued at lower of cost and net realisable value (NRV). 
However, these items are considered to be realisable at 
cost, if the finished products, in which they will be used, 
are expected to be sold at or above cost. Cost is determined 
on first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis. The cost of inventory 
comprises its purchase price, including non-refundable 
purchase taxes, and any directly attributable costs related 
to the inventories.
 
Work-in- progress (WIP), finished goods, stock-in-trade 
and trial run inventories:
 
Valued at lower of cost and NRV. Cost of Finished goods 
and WIP includes cost of raw materials, direct labour, other 
direct costs and related production overheads upto the 
relevant stage of completion.
       
    
 
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the 
ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of 
completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the 
sale.

Employee Benefits :
  
         
 
Employee benefits include Gratuity, Provident Fund, 
Employee Family Pension, Employee State Insurance 
Scheme and Compensated Absences.
 
          
 
Defined benefit plans:
        
   
 
For defined benefit plans, the cost of providing benefits is 
determined using the projected unit credit method, with 
actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each 
annual reporting period. Re-measurement, comprising 
actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the changes to the 
asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on plan assets 
(excluding net interest), is reflected immediately in the 
Balance Sheet with a charge or credit recognised in Other 
Comprehensive Income (OCI) in the period in which they 
occur. Re-measurement recognised in OCI is reflected 
immediately in retained earnings and will not be reclassified 
to Statement of Profit and Loss. Past service cost is 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period 
of a plan amendment. Net interest is calculated by applying 
the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net 
defined benefit liability or asset. Defined benefit costs are 
categorised as follows:
(i)   
 
service cost (including current service cost, past service 
cost, as well as gains and losses on curtailments and 
settlements);
(ii)  
 
net interest expense or income; and
(iii) 
 
re-measurement
 
 
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is 
calculated using a discount rate which is determined by 
reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period 
on government bonds.
 
The defined benefit obligation recognised in the Balance 
Sheet represents the actual deficit or surplus in the 
Company™s defined benefit plans. Any surplus resulting 
from this calculation is limited to the present value of any 
economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the 
plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans.
  
        
 
Defined Contribution Plan:
       
    
 
The Company™s contribution to Provident Fund and  Pension 
Fund is considered as defined contribution plans and are 
charged as an expense based on the amount of contribution 
required to be made and when services are rendered by the 
employees. Company has no further obligation beyond its 
contributions
          
          
 
Short-term employee benefits:
      
     
 
The undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits 
expected to be paid in exchange for the services rendered 
by employees are recognized during the year when the 
employees render the service. These benefits include 
compensated absences which are expected to occur within 
twelve months after the end of the period in which the 
employee renders the related service.
     
      
 
Long-term employee benefits:
      
     
 
Accumulated compensated absences, which are expected to 
be availed or encashed beyond 12 months from the end of 
the year are treated as other long-term employee benefits. 
The company™s liability is actuarially determined (using 
the Projected Unit Credit method) at the end of each year. 
Actuarial losses/gains are recognised in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss in the year in which they arise.
    
       
 
Employee Share based payment:
      
     
 
Equity settled share based payments to employees are 
measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the 
grant date. 
 
119
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity 
settled share based payments is amortised on a straight 
line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company™s 
estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with 
a corresponding increase in equity.
 
At the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its 
estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to 
vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if 
any, is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss such 
that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, 
with a corresponding adjustment to the equity-settled 
employee benefits reserve.
       
   
(j)
 
Borrowing costs :
         
  
 
Borrowing cost (General and Specific) includes interest, 
amortization of ancillary costs incurred in connection with 
the arrangement of borrowings and exchange differences 
arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent they 
are regarded as an adjustment to the interest cost.
 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of qualifying assets, which are 
assets that necessarily takes a substantial period of time 
to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to 
the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are 
substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
 
Interest income earned on the temporary investment of 
specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying 
assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for 
capitalization.
 
All other borrowing costs are recognized in the statement of 
profit and loss in the period in which they are incurred.
  
        
(k)
 
Foreign Currencies :
 
          
 
In preparing the financial statements of the Company, 
transactions in currencies other than the Company™s 
functional currency (i.e. foreign currencies) are recognised 
at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary 
items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at 
the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items carried 
at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies 
are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the 
fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are 
measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency 
are translated using the exchange rate as at the date of 
initial transactions.
 
Exchange differences on monetary items are recognised in 
the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they 
arise except for, exchange differences on foreign currency 
borrowings relating to assets under construction for future 
productive use, which are included in the cost of those 
assets when they are regarded as an adjustment to interest 
costs on those foreign currency borrowings.
    
       
(l)
 
Revenue Recognition  :
        
   
a
 
Revenue from operations
        
  
 
Revenue is recognized on the basis of approved contracts 
regarding the transfer of goods or services to a customer 
for an amount that reflects the consideration to which 
the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those 
goods or services. Revenue is measured at the fair value 
of consideration received or receivable taking into account 
the amount of discounts, rebates, outgoing taxes on sales of 
goods or services.
 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration 
received or receivable for the goods supplied and services 
rendered, net of returns, discounts and incentives to 
customers. Revenue excludes amount collected on behalf 
of third parties viz. Goods and Service Tax (GST). 
 
Revenue from contract with customer are recognised when 
goods are dispatched and the control over the goods sold 
are transferred to customers.
 
Revenue from turnkey contracts having performance 
obligation to be fulfilled over the time are recognised 
measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of 
that performance obligation. The Company measures the 
progress using the Output method. 
 
Costs to fulfill a contract which is directly related to a 
contract or to an anticipated contract, generates or enhance 
resources of the Company that will be used in satisfying 
performance obligations in the future and expected to be 
recovered are recognised as an Asset
     
     
 
Variable consideration includes discounts and incentives 
provided to the customers. It is estimated at contract 
inception considering the terms of contract with customers 
and constrained until it is highly probable that a significant 
revenue reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue 
recognised will not occur when the associated uncertainty 
with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. It 
is reassessed at end of each reporting period. 
 
120
Generally, the Company receives short-term advances from 
its customers. The Company does not expect to have any 
contracts where the period between the transfer of goods 
and payment by customer exceeds one year. Hence, the 
Company does not adjust revenue for the time value of 
money.
          
 
 
Other Income
          
 
(i)    
 
Dividend Income is accounted for when the right to 
receive the income is established.
(ii)   
 
Interest income is recognized on time proportion 
basis taking into account the amount outstanding on 
effective interest rate.
(iii) 
 
Difference between the sale price and carrying 
value of investment is recognised as profit or loss 
on sale / redemption on investment on trade date of 
transaction.
         
 
(m)
 
Government Grants
         
  
 
Government Grants, related to assets, are recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss on a systematic basis over the 
periods in which the Company recognises the related costs 
for which the grants are intended to compensate. 
 
Government grants related to income are recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they 
become receivable.
 
Government grants are not recognised until there is 
reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with 
the conditions attached to them  and that the grants will be 
received.

Lease:
           
           
 
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) has vide notification 
dated March 30, 2019 has mandated applicability of Ind AS 
116 (Leases) from April 1, 2019.
       
    
n.1 
 
The Company as a Lessee:
 
The Company, at the inception of a contract, assesses 
whether the contract is a lease or not lease. A contract 
is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to 
control the use of an identified asset for a time in exchange 
for a consideration. This policy has been applied to contracts 
existing and entered into on or after April 1, 2019.
 
The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease 
liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use 
asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the 
initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease 
payments made at or before the commencement date, plus 
any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to 
dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the 
underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any 
lease incentives received. 
 
The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the 
straight-line method from the commencement date to the 
end of the lease term. The right-of-use asset is periodically 
reviewed for impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for 
certain re-measurements of the lease liability.
 
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of 
the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement 
date, discounted using the the Company™s incremental 
borrowing rate. 
 
Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease 
liability comprise the following:
Œ 
 
fixed payments, including in-substance fixed 
payments;
Œ 
 
variable lease payments that depend on an index or a 
rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the 
commencement date;
Œ 
 
amounts expected to be payable under a residual value 
guarantee; and
Œ 
 
the exercise price under a purchase option that 
the company is reasonably certain to exercise, 
 
lease payments in an optional renewal period if 
the company is reasonably certain to exercise an 
extension option, and penalties for early termination of 
a lease unless the company is reasonably certain not 
to terminate early
 
It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease 
payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if 
there is a change in the Company™s estimate of the amount 
expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, 
or if the Company changes its assessment of whether it will 
exercise a purchase, extension or termination option. When 
the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding 
adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-
of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying 
amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.ﬂ
 
          
n.2 
 
Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
           
 
The Company has chosen not to recognise right-of-use 
assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have 
a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value 
assets. The Company recognises the lease payments 
121
associated with these leases as an expense over the lease 
term.
          
 
n.3 
 
Under Ind AS 17
           
 
In the comparative period, at the inception of a lease, the 
lease arrangement is classified as either a finance lease 
or an operating lease, based on the substance of the lease 
arrangement.
  
         
 
Operating Lease:
 
Lease rentals are charged or recognised in the Statement 
of Profit and Loss on a straight-line basis over the lease 
term, except where the payment are structured to increase 
in line with expected general inflation to compensate for the 
expected inflationary cost increase.
      
    
 
Finance Lease:
 
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets 
of the Company at their fair value at the inception of the 
lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments. The corresponding liability to the lessor is 
included in the Balance Sheet as a finance lease obligation. 
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges 
and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a 
constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the 
liability. Finance charges are charged to the Statement 
of Profit and Loss, unless they are directly attributable to 
qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in 
accordance with the Company™s policy on borrowing costs.
 
         
(o)
 
Income Taxes:
          
 
 
Tax expense represents the sum of the current tax and 
deferred tax.
          
 
 
Current Tax 
          
 
 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the 
year. Current tax is measured at the amount expected to be 
paid to the tax authorities, based on estimated tax liability 
computed after taking credit for allowances and exemption 
in accordance with the local tax laws. The Company™s current 
tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
 
          
 
Deferred tax 
          
 
 
Deferred tax is provided, on all temporary differences at the 
reporting date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax 
rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary 
differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. 
Tax relating to items recognised directly in equity or OCI is 
recognised in equity or OCI and not in the Statement Profit 
and Loss.
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a 
legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and 
assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same 
tax authority.
 
A deferred tax asset is recognized to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax 
assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced 
to the extent that it is no longer probable.
    
      
(p)
 
Earnings per share :
  
         
 
A basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the profit/
(loss) for the year attributable to equity shareholders by 
the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding 
during the year. Diluted earnings per share is computed by 
dividing the profit/(loss) for the year attributable to equity 
shareholders by the weighted average number of equity 
shares considered for deriving basic earnings per share and 
the weighted average number of equity shares which could 
have been issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential 
equity shares.
 
Potential equity shares are deemed to be dilutive only 
if their conversion to equity shares would decrease the 
net profit per share from continuing ordinary operations. 
Potential dilutive equity shares are deemed to be converted 
as at the beginning of the period, unless they have been 
issued at a later date. The dilutive potential equity shares 
are adjusted for the proceeds receivable had the shares 
been actually issued at fair value (i.e. average market value 
of the outstanding shares). Dilutive potential equity shares 
are determined independently for each period presented.
 
          
(q)
 
Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets 
and Commitments :
         
 
 
 
Provisions are recognized when the Company has a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, 
it is probable that the Company will be required to settle 
the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligation.
 
The amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate 
of the consideration required to settle the present obligation 
at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the 
122
risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligations. When 
a provision is measured using the cash flow estimated to 
settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the 
present obligations of those cash flows (when the effect of 
the time value of money is material).
 
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle 
a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, 
a receivable is recognized as an asset if it is virtually certain 
that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the 
receivable can be measured reliably.
 
Contingent liabilities and Contingent assets are not 
recognized in the financial statements.
           
 
Contingent assets are not recognised in financial statements 
since this may result in the recognition of income that may 
never be realised. However, when the realisation of income 
is virtually certain, then the related asset is not a contingent 
asset and is recognised. A contingent asset is disclosed, in 
financial statements, where an inflow of economic benefits 
is probable.
          
 
(r)
 
Financial Instruments:
 
          
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when 
a Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instruments.
 
    
 
Initial Recognition
         
  
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured 
at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable 
to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial 
liabilities (other than  financial assets and financial liabilities 
at fair value through profit or loss and ancillary costs related 
to borrowings) are added to or deducted from the fair value 
of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, 
on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable 
to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at 
fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately 
in Statement of Profit and Loss.
 
          
 
Classification and Subsequent Measurement: Financial 
Assets
          
 
 
The Company classifies financial assets as subsequently 
measured at amortised cost, fair value through other 
comprehensive income (ﬁFVOCIﬂ) or fair value through profit 
or loss (ﬁFVTPLﬂ) on the basis of following:
(i)  
 
the entity™s business model for managing the financial 
assets and
(ii) 
 
the contractual cash flow characteristics of the 
financial asset.
         
  
 
Amortised Cost
          
 
 
A financial asset shall be classified and measured at 
amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met:
(i)  
 
the financial asset is held within a business model 
whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to 
collect contractual cash flows and
(ii) 
 
the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on 
specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments 
of principal and interest on the principal amount 
outstanding.
 
          
 
In case of financial asset classified and measured at 
amortised cost, any interest income, foreign exchange gains/
losses and impairment are recognised in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss.
         
           
 
Fair Value through OCI
        
   
 
A financial asset shall be classified and measured at fair 
value through OCI if both of the following conditions are 
met:
(i)  
 
the financial asset is held within a business model 
whose objective is achieved by both collecting 
contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and
(ii) 
 
the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on 
specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments 
of principal and interest on the principal amount 
outstanding.
 
Where the Company has elected to present the fair value 
gain on equity instruments in other comprehensive income, 
there is no subsequent classification of fair value gain 
or losses to profit and loss account. Dividend from such 
instruments is recognized in profit and loss account as other 
income where right to receive is established.ﬂ
    
       
 
Fair Value through Profit or Loss
      
     
 
A financial asset shall be classified and measured at 
fair value through profit or loss unless it is measured at 
amortised cost or at fair value through OCI. All recognised 
financial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety 
at either amortised cost or fair value, depending on the 
classification of the financial assets. For financial assets at 
fair value through profit or loss, net gain or losses, including 
123
any interest or dividend income are recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
       
    
 
Classification and Subsequent Measurement: Financial 
liabilities
          
 
 
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities 
at FVTPL or ‚other financial liabilities™.
     
      
 
Financial Liabilities at FVTPL
       
    
 
Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL when the 
financial liability is held for trading or are designated upon 
initial recognition as FVTPL. Gains or Losses on liabilities 
held for trading are recognised in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss.
      
 
Other Financial Liabilities
       
    
 
Other financial liabilities (including borrowings and trade and 
other payables) are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense 
(based on effective interest method), foreign exchange 
gains and losses and any gain or loss on derecognition is 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
   
        
 
Impairment of financial assets
       
    
 
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for 
indicators of impairment at the end of each reporting period. 
The Company recognises a loss allowance for expected 
credit losses on financial asset. In case of trade receivables, 
the Company follows the simplified approach permitted 
by Ind AS 109 Œ Financial Instruments for recognition of 
impairment loss allowance. The application of simplified 
approach does not require the Company to track changes 
in credit risk. The Company calculates the expected credit 
losses on trade receivables using a provision matrix on the 
basis of its historical credit loss experience.
 
          
 
Derecognition of financial assets
      
     
 
The Company derecognises a financial asset when the 
contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or 
when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the 
risks and rewards of the asset or if, the Company has neither 
transferred nor retained substantially all risk and reward of 
the asset, but has transferred control of the asset to another 
party. 
 
On derecognition of a financial asset, other than investments 
classified as FVOCI, in its entirety, the difference between the 
asset™s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration 
received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that 
had been recognised in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated in equity is recognised in profit or loss if such 
gain or loss would have otherwise been recognised in profit 
or loss on disposal of that financial asset.
 
On derecognition of equity investments classified as FVOCI, 
accumulated gains or loss recognised in OCI is transferred 
to retained earnings.
          
 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments:
    
       
(i) 
 
Classification as debt or equity
 
Debt and equity instruments issued by the Company 
are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity 
in accordance with the substance of the contractual 
arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and 
an equity instrument.
(ii) 
 
Equity instruments
 
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a 
residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all 
of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by a Company are 
recognised at the proceeds received.
     
   
(s)
 
Cash and cash equivalents :
 
          
 
Cash and cash equivalents in the Balance Sheet comprise 
cash at bank, Cheques and Cash in hand and short-term 
deposits with banks that are readily convertible into cash 
which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value 
and are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash 
commitments.
          
 
(t)
 
Derivative financial instruments :
 
          
 
The Company enters into derivative financial instruments 
viz. foreign exchange forward contracts and cross currency 
swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate, foreign 
exchange rate risks and commodity prices. The Company 
does not hold derivative financial instruments for speculative 
purposes.
 
 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the 
derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting 
period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or 
loss immediately excluding derivatives designated as cash 
flow hedge.
    
124
(u)
 
Hedge accounting:
 
          
 
The Company designates certain hedging instruments in 
respect of foreign currency risk and interest rate risk price 
risk as cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge 
relationship, the entity documents the relationship between 
the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its 
risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking 
various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of 
the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Company documents 
whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in 
offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged 
item attributable to the hedged risk.
           
 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the 
designated portion of derivatives that qualify as cash flow 
hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated under equity. The gain or loss relating to the 
ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
 
 
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in equity relating to effective 
portion as described above are reclassified to profit or loss 
in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss, in 
the same line as the recognised hedged item. However, when 
the hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of 
a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, such gains 
and losses are transferred from equity and included in the 
initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or 
non-financial liability.
  
         
 
Hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when 
the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or 
exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. 
Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income 
and accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity and 
is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately 
recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is 
no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in 
equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
   
        
Note 1(B): Critical accounting judgements and key sources 
of estimation uncertainty 
       
   
  
The preparation of the Company™s financial statements 
requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, 
expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying 
disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. 
Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could 
result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the 
carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future 
periods.
 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
     
      
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key 
sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that 
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the 
next financial year, are described below. The Company 
based its assumptions and estimates on parameters 
available when the financial statements were prepared. 
Existing circumstances and assumptions about future 
developments, however, may change due to market changes 
or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the 
Company. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions 
when they occur.
         
  
(i) 
 
Useful lives of property, plant and equipment :
   
        
 
The Company uses its technical expertise along with historical 
and industry trends for determining the economic life of an 
asset/component of an asset. The useful lives are reviewed 
by management periodically and revised, if appropriate. In 
case of a revision, the unamortised depreciable amount is 
charged over the remaining useful life of the assets.
   
        
(ii) 
 
Defined benefit obligation :
       
    
 
The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and the 
present value of the gratuity obligation are determined 
using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves 
making various assumptions that may differ from actual 
developments in the future. These include the determination 
of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality 
rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and 
its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly 
sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions 
are reviewed at each reporting date.
      
   
(iii) 
 
Fair value measurement of Financial Instruments :
   
        
 
When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities 
recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on 
quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured 
using valuation techniques including the Discounted Cash 
Flow model. The inputs to these models are taken from 
observable markets where possible, but where this is not 
feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing 
fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs 
such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility.
    
    
(iv) 
 
Income taxes :
          
 
 
Significant judgements are involved in estimating budgeted 
profits for the purpose of paying advance tax, determining 
125
the provision for income taxes, including amount expected 
to be paid/recovered for uncertain tax positions.
   
        
(v) 
 
Revenue from turnkey project :
      
     
 
During the year, the Company has recognised revenue 
and cost from this project. Due to the nature of the 
project, recognition of revenue and cost involves usage of 
percentage of completion method which is determined 
based on the progress towards complete satisfaction of 
that performance obligation, which involves significant 
judgments, identification of contractual obligations and the 
Company™s rights to receive payments for performance 
completed till date.
         
  
(vi) 
 
Leases :
          
 
 
The Company considers all the extension-options under the 
commercial contract for determining the lease-term which 
forms the basis for the measurement of right-of-use asset 
and the corresponding lease-liability.
     
     
 
(vii) 
 
Share-based payments :
        
   
 
The Company measures the cost of equity-settled 
transactions with employees using Black-Scholes model 
to determine the fair value of the liability incurred on the 
grant date. Estimating fair value for share-based payment 
transactions requires determination of the most appropriate 
valuation model, which is dependent on the terms and 
conditions of the grant.  This estimate also requires 
determination of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation 
model including the expected life of the share option, 
volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about 
them. The assumptions and models used for estimating fair 
value for share-based payment transactions are disclosed 
in Note 37.
          
         
(viii) 
 
Discount, Incentives & Rebates :
      
     
 
Revenue is measured net of discounts, incentives, rebates 
etc. given to the customers on the Company™s sales. The 
Company™s presence across different marketing regions 
within the country and the competitive business environment 
makes the assessment of various type of discounts, 
incentives and rebates as complex and judgmental.

A.
 
Market Risk
 
         
Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values 
or future cash flows that may result from a change in the 
price of a financial instrument. The value of a financial 
instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest 
rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, 
equity prices and other market changes that affect market 
risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to 
all market risk sensitive financial instruments including 
investments and deposits, foreign currency receivables, 
payables and borrowings.

1) 
 
Foreign Currency risk
 
         
Foreign currency risk is the risk of impact related to fair value 
or future cash flows of an exposure in foreign currency, 
which fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. 
The Company™s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign 
exchange rates relates primarily to import of raw materials, 
capital expenditure and exports. When a derivative is 
entered for the purpose of being a hedge, the Company 
negotiates the terms of those derivatives to match the terms 
of the hedged exposure.
 
The Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising 
from foreign currency transactions. The Company follows 
established risk management policies and procedures. It 
uses derivative instruments like foreign currency forwards 
and cross currency swaps to hedge exposure to foreign 
currency risk.

Interest Rate Risk
          
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash 
flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of 
changes in market interest rates. The company™s exposure to 
the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily 
to the company™s term loans and short term borrowing with 
floating interest rate. For foreign currency loan with floating 
rate, the risk of variation in interest rate is mitigated through 
cross currency swap. The company constantly monitors the 
credit markets and rebalances its financing strategies to 
achieve an optimal maturity profile and financing cost.

Commodity Price Risk
        
  
 
Commodity price risk for the Company is mainly related to 
fluctuations in raw material prices linked to various external 
factors, which can affect the production cost of the Company. 
To manage this risk, the Company monitors factors affecting 
prices, identifies new sources of supply of raw material, 
monitors inventory level, etc. Additionally, processes and 
policies related to such risks are reviewed and controlled 
by senior management and monitored by the procurement 
department.
          
          
B. 
 
Credit Risk Management
          
 
Credit risk arises when a customer or counterparty does not 
meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer 
contract, leading to a financial loss. The Company is exposed 
to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade 
receivables) and from its financing / investing activities, 
including deposits with banks, foreign exchange transactions 
and financial guarantees. The Company has no significant 
concentration of credit risk with any counterparty.
   
            
Trade Receivable
 
         
 
Trade receivables are consisting of a large number of 
customers / distributors. The Company has credit evaluation 
policy for each customer / distributor and based on the 
evaluation credit limit of each customer / distributor is 
defined. The  Company™s marketing team are responsible 
for monitoring receivable on periodical basis. Wherever the 
Company assesses the credit risk as high, the exposure is 
backed by security deposits and post dated cheques. 
         
 
Total trade receivable as on March 31, 2020 
`
 1,797.08 
million (March 31, 2019 is 
`
 2,503.61 million.)
    
     
 
As per simplified approach, the Company makes provision of 
expected credit losses on trade receivables using a provision 
matrix to mitigate the risk of default payments and makes 
appropriate provision at each reporting date wherever 
outstanding is for longer period and involves higher risk. 
The policy for creating provision for credit losses on trade 
receivables is as per following provision matrix:- 
  
Particular
Loss 
Allowance 
Provision
0 to year
Nil
Above one year and less than two year
20%
Above two year and less than three year
40%
Above three year and less than four year
80%
More than four year 
100%
Further, in addition to the provisions as per provision matrix, 
the Company also provides for credit allowances on specific 
identification basis.

Investments, Derivative Instruments, Cash and Cash

Credit Risk on cash and cash equivalent, deposits with 
the banks / financial institutions is generally low as the 
said deposits have been made with the banks / financial 
institutions who have been assigned high credit rating by 
international and domestic rating agencies.
   
           
Credit Risk on Derivative Instruments are generally low 
as Company enters into the Derivative Contracts with the 
reputed Banks and Financial Institutions.
     
     
C.
 
Liquidity Risk
         
 
 
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company will 
not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at 
reasonable price. Prudent liquidity risk management implies 
maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities and 
the availability of funding through an adequate amount of 
credit facilities to meet obligations when due. The Company™s 
treasury team is responsible for liquidity, funding as well as 
settlement management. In addition, processes and policies 
related to such risks are overseen by senior management. 
Management monitors the Company™s liquidity position 
through rolling forecasts on the basis of expected cash 
flows.
          
 
The table below provides details regarding the remaining 
contractual maturities of financial liabilities and investments 
held for managing the risk at the reporting date based on 
contractual undiscounted payments.

Fair Value measurements (Ind AS 113)
     
     
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are 
included at the amount at which the instrument could be 
exchanged in an orderly transaction in the principal (or 
most advantageous) market at measurement date under the 
current market condition regardless of whether that price 
is directly observable or estimated using other valuation 
techniques. The Company has established the following fair 
value hierarchy that categorises the values into 3 levels. The 
inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value of 
financial instruments are:
 
 
Level 1: This hierarchy uses quoted (unadjusted) prices 
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The fair 
value of all quoted investments which are traded in the 
stock exchanges is valued using the closing price or dealer 
quotations as at the reporting date. 
 
Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not 
traded in an active market is determined using valuation 
techniques which maximize the use of observable market 
data and rely as little as possible on company specific 
estimates. Unquoted investments are valued using the 
closing Net Asset Value. If all significant inputs required to 
fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is 
included in Level 2. 
 
Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on 
observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.

The management assessed that cash and bank balances, 
trade receivables, trade payables, cash credits and other 
financial assets and liabilities approximate their carrying 
amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these 
instruments.
          
           
The following methods and assumptions were used to 
estimate the fair values:
(a) 
 
The fair values of the quoted investments are based on 
market price/net asset value at the reporting date. 
(b)
 
 The fair value of unquoted investments is based on 
closing Net Assets Value.
(c) 
 
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts 
is calculated as the present value determined using 
forward exchange rates and interest rate curve of the 
respective currencies.
(d) 
 
The fair value of currency swap is calculated as the 
present value determined using forward exchange 
rates, currency basis spreads between the respective 
currencies, interest rate curves and an appropriate 
discount factor.
(e) 
 
The fair value of the remaining financial instruments 
is determined using discounted cash flow analysis. 
The discount rates used is based on management 
estimates.

of computation of Provident Fund contribution.  Pending 
directions or clarification from the EPFO, the quantification 
of impact, if any, is not ascertainable and consequently no

 Asset Liability matching strategy: 
 
            
The money contributed by the Company to the Gratuity fund to finance the liabilities of the plan has to be invested for funded 
gratuity plan. The Company has outsourced the investment management of the fund to an Insurance Company. The Insurance 
Company in turn manages these funds as per the permissible limits prescribed in the insurance regulation. Due to the restriction 
in the type of investment that can be held by the fund,it is not possible to explicitly follow an asset libility matching strategy. 
There is no compulsion on the part of the Company to fully prefund the liability of the Plan.
