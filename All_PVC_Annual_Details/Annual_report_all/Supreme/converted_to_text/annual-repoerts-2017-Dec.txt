  THE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED
Management Discussion and Analysis
1.
 
OVERVIEW
 
There were far reaching structural reforms implemented in the 
Indian economy in the last seventeen months starting from 

November 2016. In the process these measures have put the 
economy on sound growth path. They augur well to put the 
economy in high growth mode in future.
 
The most significant reform was introduction of Goods and 

Service Tax w.e.f 1.7.2017. This single measure has integrated 

the Country™s economy. Overall, the incidence of indirect tax 

has come down on most of the products by this measure of 
merging several indirect taxes and cess charged on the products 
in different States prior to July 2017.
 
The streamlining of GST implementation and Tax rates took 

some time. That has created upheaval in 1st half of last year. 

For your Company™s business, the introduction of Realty 

Estate regulation Act (RERA) has also affected growth of piping 

business in Housing Sector for several months.
 
The several initiatives taken by Government to boost rural 

income and infrastructure are now fructifying to boost business 
in several segments which are catered by the Company . The 
Company, therefore, envisaged a faster growth in business 

from April 2018 and beyond. On the basis of the promising 

future demand growth, the Company started committing larger 
investments during the year than planned at beginning of the 
year.
 
Due to hardening of Polymer Prices and lack of new capacity 

build up of the PVC resin all around the world, the PVC 

prices have moved to higher band. For the year 2018-19, it is 

expected that the PVC price trend will remain on higher side. 

In spite of increase in Crude prices, the prices of Polythene 
will move to a lower level over the year as several new plants 
are starting in USA based on the low feed stock cost of Shale 

gas. Overall, the polymer prices will remain affordable.
 
The effect of Demonetization , GST and RERA looks to have 

settled down to a large extent. The economy is moving to 

formal sector slowly, but surely from informal sector. This 
augurs well to boost the economic activity in the Country. The 
initial forecast for Monsoon this year is also normal. Company, 

therefore, expects business conditions to be favorable in the 

year to boost the demand for it™s products.
 
The Company expects to put two new Greenfield plants 

in production this year Œ one at Telangana and another at 

Rajasthan. The Company™s additional construction of buildings 
in existing plants and start up of production at those sites will 
also go in production this year at Malanpur, Khopoli, Hosur 

and Kharagpur.
 
The Company intends to start two new plants at Andhra 

Pradesh and Assam. Land acquisition process has started. They 

may partially go into production next year.
 
The Company™s units to make up automobile products at 

Khuskhera has been put in JV with a Japanese Company. The 
Company may divest it™s small holding in that Unit within 2-3 
years after start up of this J.V

further distributors in the past year. The distributors strength

to 2973 nos by March 2017.
 
Wherever the Company could not find suitable distributors 

to buy and stock Company™s products for re-distribution 

throughout the retail chain of that area, the Company started 

selling products directly to big retailers in that area. Selectively, 
the Company has strengthened it™s supply system to service 
those retailers in a cost efficient manner. The Company started 

this only very selectively.
 
Your Company™s Supreme brand is now registered with a 

punch line ﬁ Supreme Œ People who know plastics best.ﬂ

and abroad along with large meets of plumbers, Dealers, 
Retailers and Architects. The Company participated in several 

exhibitions in India and internationally last year. Secondly 

Company is taking legal recourse to contain counterfeit 
products in Plastics pipe System, XF Products and Furniture.

Plastics Piping Systems
 
The Company continues its objective to grow in Plastic Pipe 

System business. The company is leader in this segment as it has 

the largest portfolio of products, which is being continuously 
increased, to offer more systems as required in the economy.
 
The introduction of GST regime in the country augured well 

for growth of this business. There is likelihood of shift in 
business from unorganized players to organized players over 

the period. This is expected to lead to growth in the business 

of your Company in forthcoming years. 
 
The Company during the year under review registered an over 

all revenue growth of 10% in Plastic Piping System made from 

different plastic materials. Overall the company sold 2,56,330 
Tons of Pipe System compared to 2,35,256 Tons in same period 
of last year.
 
The growth in the business was not upto Company™s 

expectation. GST introduction has put damper in Agri market 

requirement in April/June. Real Estate Regulation Act (RERA) 
to regulate the Housing Sector has slowed down the demand 
from this sector for quite a period.
 
The Government at the Centre and States has put the priority 

focus on Swatch Bharat Abhiyan, Sanitation and affordable 

houses to all and development of 100 smart cities on all 

India basis. Real Estate Regulation Act (RERA) has created a 
major transformation the way housing construction for sale 
was in vogue in the Country. It affected the business growth 

in Housing in the year under review. The growth tempo has 

now started and the Company expects good demand coming 
from this segment in this year. 
 
The Company incurred Capex of 
R 
144 crore in this year in it™s 
various plants to build more capacities and increase product 
range. Majority of them has been put to use .
 
The Company with objective of making its footprint for 

manufacturing at South Zone, for Plastic Piping Division, 

has got 50 acres of land allotted at Jadcherla-District 
Mahaboobnagar at Telangana. The civil construction work 
has started and production of Water & Septic Tanks is likely to 

start in October/December ™2018. The Company will launch 

other Piping System products at this location in next one/ two 

year. The Company has entered into a MOU with the State 
Government of Andhra Government to put up a project at 
Nellore district. Efforts are being made to acquire the required 

land of approx. 40 acres to start the manufacturing there. The 

Company aims to start production at the same site in second 
half of 2019-2020.
 
The plant at Kharagpur is fully operational. The capacity 
increase for PVC,HDPE & CPVC Pipes is now in place and 

become operational. The Company is also exploring further 

increasing the capacity of HDPE Pipe at Kharagpur plant to 

cater to increased demand.
 
To meet the increasing demand of HDPE Pipes in North India, 

the Company has taken in hand to put up the capacity in 
Malanpur Unit No.3. The same will go in production in July/
September 2018 quarter.
 
Another Roto Moulding plant is now operational at Kharagpur. 

The enhanced capacity at Gadegaon facility for Roto Moulded 
Products is made operational. The capacity of Roto Moulded 
Products is being planned to increase at Malanpur and Kanpur 

plant. 
 
The production of Double Wall Corrugated HDPE Pipes 

has started from Gadegaon plant with BIS Certification. The 

company has also started commercial production of Double 
Wall Corrugated HDPE Pipes at Kharagpur. At Kharagpur the 
BIS certification for Pipes up to diameter of 500 mm is received 

and for balance sizes of 600 mm and 800 mm diameter is 

likely to be received shortly.

  THE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED
 
The company introduced 195 nos. of variety of Injection 
Moulded Pipe fittings during 2017-18. They all have been well 

received in the market. The sale of moulded fittings increased 
by 6% in volume terms during the year under review. The 
Company has plan of introducing further new items during 

the year as per system requirement.
 
The Company manufactures the cPVC Pipes at three of 

its manufacturing location and cPVC Fittings at two of its 

manufacturing locations. The Company has planned further 
expansion of CPVC System manufacturing at it™s existing plants. 
The total product portfolio in Pipe System has reached 7730 

nos., thus adding 500 products to the range of various Plastic 

Piping System.
 
The AQUAKRAFT Bath Fittings introduced by the company 

is well established now including newly launched Chrome 

Plated range. There were 11 new items introduced during the 
year. The portfolio in Bath Fittings has reached to 100 items. 
For test market, Company also imported 16 variety of Bath 

Fittings to service local market. The Company plans to further 

complement the range during 2018-19 by introducing large 
varieties of products in Bath fittings. 
 
The Company™s business to Export market during the year saw 

a growth of 48% in US $ terms. The company is continuously 
trying to boost its export business of Piping Systems. 
 
The Division™s Value Added Products sale was 31.76%. The 

company has also added further 68 direct business Channel 

partners during the year taking the total to 984 Nos.. The 

Company continues to expand its reach by appointing 

Distributors in areas where there is a gap. The company has 
also started directly servicing retailers in selected markets.
 
The Company has now multiple Knowledge Centres across 

the country to facilitate the services locally. At Gadegaon for 
the customers of Western India, at Kochi for the customers of 

Southern India, at Malanpur for customers of Northern India 

and at Kharagpur for customers of Eastern India. 
 
Although Company™s CPVC Fire Sprinkler System is approved 

by Bureau of Indian Standard (BIS) and is also Underwriters 
Laboratories (UL) listed, still the Company needs product 
approval to install in Residential /Commercial Buildings. 

There is no single authority to approve the product and every 

State Government has their own rules and regulations to be 

followed in their States. Certain states got Central Authority 
called ﬁDirector Fire Servicesﬂ and the approval is acceptable 
to all the Fire Officers and Fire stations within their States. 

But in certain States the Company has to seek approval from 

every Chief Fire Officer of a city which has status of Municipal 
Corporation. Seeking approval is a time consuming process. 
Thus the growth in this segment will be slow though it is 

internationally proven a better system than metal Fire Sprinkler 

System for Horizontal Application.
 
The BIS has not yet published the standard for CPVC Fire 

Sprinkler Fittings and also many amendments to IS- 15105, 

which is a standard for design and installation of Fire Sprinkler 
System. Although National Building Code 2016 has been 
published the implementation part has still not gathered pace. 

As a result the awareness about mandatory installation of CPVC 

Fire Sprinkler System in High-rise Residential Apartments as 
well as Commercial buildings is not catching the momentum.
 
The Company is putting lot of efforts in creating awareness 
about it™s products by meeting various Developers, Consultants 

and Installers in all the major Metropolitan and Tier-I cities. As 
a result of these efforts the Company could install this system 
at Mumbai, Pune and Goa locations for many upcoming High-

rise Buildings. These installations will work as a showcase to 

present it to future buyers, consultants and installers.
 
The installers who did the mock-up installations are truly 

satisfied. They see tremendous benefit because of ease and 

speed of installation while using this product. They have 

confirmed that the speed of installation is four times faster 
than the earlier metal installations and the skill requirement 
is less as no welding or threading operations are involved. 
 
The Company has developed moulds for fast running fittings 
and the samples are already under testing with Underwriters 
Laboratories (UL). This will enhance Company™s efficiency in 

delivering the products to the end users with speed.
 
The Company has started participating in various ﬁFire and 

Safetyﬂ Exhibitions in India as well as abroad as part of 
promotional activities. This is helping in creating awareness to 
‚Supreme Flameguard™ Brand . The Company is getting good 

response from Indian as well as Overseas buyers.
 
Apart from installation in India the Company has supplied it™s 

products to a hotel project in Sri Lanka and to a renowned 

distributor in Philippines.
 
The Company expects that most of the regulatory approvals 
will be over and indigenous development of products should 
be complete during the current Calendar year. The business 

may catch momentum from the second half of the current 

financial year. 
 
To support environment concern the Company is gearing up 

to meet with National Green Tribunal and court directive of 

phasing out Lead stabilizers from manufacturing of different 

types of u PVC Pipes. The Company is planning a phased 
out schedule for different variety of PVC Pipes having Lead 
stabilizers to produce with Lead free stabilizers.

The business during the year had a good growth. The company 
grew by 11 % on value terms and 8 % on volume terms where 
as the overall Plastic Furniture Industry grew by only 4 % on 

value terms. The company faced initial hiccups in business with 
GST regime. Sales in First Quarter were extremely sluggish due 
to introduction of GST and reduction in pipeline inventory 

with trade channels. Further, the GST rate which was kept at 

28 % in the beginning had an adverse effect on the business. 
However, reduction in GST rate from 28 % to 18 % gave boost 
to the business and the growth in second half of 2017-18 was 

a healthy 16% on value terms. The company believes that with 

reduction in GST rate & effective compliance, the share of 

organized players should increase in overall plastic furniture 
business over the period.
 
The company currently manufactures Injection Moulded 

Furniture & Blow Moulded Furniture. It has 5 units 
manufacturing Injection Moulded Furniture across the country 

at Puducherry (UT), Durgapur (West Bengal), Derabassi 
THE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED  
  
43
(Punjab), Gadegaon (Maharashtra) & Guwahati (Assam) to 
cater effectively different regions of the country. The company 

has also started manufacturing Blow Moulded Tables at its 
Kharagpur (West Bengal) plant. The company is putting up a 
Green Field Plant at Jadcherla ( Telangana ) for manufacture 

of Injection Moulded Furniture for increasing its market share 

in Southern India. The company believes the new plant will 
also be a good feeder unit for all other parts of the country 
due to its central location and good connectivity. The plant 

is likely to go in production by third quarter of this year and 

contribute to growth in last two quarters. 
 
The growth in company™s business is primarily attributed to 

its continuing focus on increasing its distribution set up and 

delivering high quality product & service to its customers. The 
company™s furniture is currently available to its customers 
through nationwide network of around 11,000 retailers .The 

company has established itself as a premium brand amongst 

its trade channel and customers due to its continuous focus 
on Quality, innovation and wide range of products. During the 
year, the company increased its strength of channel partners 

from 814 Nos. to 900 Nos. and continues to increase its 

presence in the unrepresented areas. 
 
The company™s new product line of Blow Moulded Tables 

has been well received by customers and is considered as top 

class in Quality. At present, the company is offering Tables in 
8 Sizes and will be adding 4 more sizes by end of September 
2018. The company also plans to develop more products to 

cater different market segments.
 
The product line requires intensive marketing combined 

with education about its benefits vis a vis other conventional 

wooden tables and the company hopes to grow in 2018-19 
in this segment primarily from domestic market. The export 
potential for this product line is big. The Company™s quality 

of product is far superior comparable to competitive products 

in the world market. Once the range becomes large and get 

well established in domestic market , then the Company aims 
to launch it™s product in international markets.
 
The company introduced 7 new furniture models during 

the year. The Fusion Series of Cupboards found very high 
acceptance amongst the customers due to its unique aesthetic 

deign. The company also launched its two seater rattan finish 

Love Seat Sofa which made an ideal combination with its fast 
selling model Cambridge Chair and Vegas Center Table . The 
complete set has been well appreciated in domestic as well as 

International Market. All the new models introduced during 

the year were well appreciated and the company hopes to get 

good growth from its new introductions. 
 
The company continues to focus on developing its export 

market and has found good acceptance by various customers. 
The company has now started exports to Twelve countries and 
hopes to grow substantially from this segment. The Company 

participates in several exhibitions to promote it™s quality 

products.

The year started against the backdrop of improved business 

sentiments resulting from gradual economic recovery because 
of various reforms initiated by the government. Demand revival 

took momentum in various segments including Automotive 

and Consumer Durable sector in which the Division has major 

business portfolio. At the beginning of the year, the Division 

had projected growth of 20% and 12% in Value and Volume 
terms in both the sectors put together. The initial negative effect 
of major economic Structural Reforms like Demonetization 

and GST having faded, demand progressively picked up 

in all segments of Automobile sector like 2 Wheeler/3 
Wheeler, Cars/SUVs and Commercial Vehicles and in White 
Goods like washing Machines, Refrigerators and other home 

appliances. The good monsoon also helped demand boost in 

Automotive and Appliances. Division grew by 31% and 18% 

respectively in Volume and Value terms over previous year. 
With microeconomic parameters encouraging, GST getting 
stabilized and improved confidence in economy, the Company 

expects further expansion in demand which should pave the 

way for further growth during the current year. 
 
Noida Plant
 revenue had improved significantly during the 

year under review and grew by 46% . Noida plant improved 
its customer base to have sizable spread in non-Appliances to 
counter seasonal demand volatility. Hence plant could achieve 

fairly uniform production with low level of volatility. Demand 

for AC segment improved considerably showing healthy 

growth. Company expects AC segment to grow significantly 
and concentrating on new customer development in this 
product line. In order to meet improved demand of one of 

Company™s major AC customer and reduce logistics cost for 

the customer, company decided to put up a new plant at 
Ghiloth
, Rajasthan and started the project work in full swing. 
The project is already at last leg of completion and expected 

to go in production in April-June, quarter. With the continued 

efforts in developing new Business Mix, company expects 

steady growth at Noida plant in future. Lot of steps were taken 
to carry out layout changes and many other improvements to 
make the plant future ready as the plant is three decade old 

and was requiring revamp. During the year, the Plant cleared 

Initial Assessment and Final Audit for TPM Excellence by JIPM 
(Japan Institute of Plant Maintenance). The Plant received the 
prestigious Award of TPM Excellence during the year. The 

movement will be accelerated further to next level during the 

years to come.

SUV model of Honda Car, WR-V. Development is on for 
several other models for Maruti Suzuki and Honda. Company 

has been continuously exploring good business opportunities 
from Maruti, Honda and other tier one customers in many of 
their new models. However, it is felt that Company needs to 

strengthen its capabilities and reorganize not only a component 

supplier but also to become complete source of supply right 
from designing, development to supply of products which can 
be done effectively by the Company having such technical 

strength and capabilities.
 
Keeping the same in mind,Company has entered into a 

joint venture with Kumi Kasei Co., Ltd (Kumi), a company

supplier to Honda for many interior parts for automotive 
application all over the world. They have been Company™s 

Technology Partner for the last six years for Company™s 

automotive supplies to Honda in India. The JVC would take 
over Khushkhera plant operations as a going concern on a 
slump sale basis. Transaction is likely to be completed by 

30th June, 2018. This Joint Venture may further improve 

technological competence of the Auto Comp Business and 

will help in strengthening Company™s relationship with all it™s 
customers.
 
Business opportunities are encouraging for 
Chennai Plant
. 

Plant registered growth of only 4% as company couldn™t grab 
the business opportunities due to capacity constraints in the 

plant. Currently plant is running at its optimum capacity. 

Company is now in the process of acquiring land adjacent to 
its existing facility, which will be used for expanding the plant. 
Company plans to expand and increase the plant capacity to 

facilitate acquiring future opportunities. Bosch has set up its 

huge manufacturing facility in India, at Chennai and would be 

launching various other Home Appliance products during next 
few years. Company expects good growth with this customer 
in years to come. The prospects in automotive sector for this 

unit are looking bright and it is expected to form a significant 

portion of plant revenue. Company has planned to realign its 
Customer-Mix for more productive capacity utilization.

Company has initiated some layout changes for optimum 
utilization of space, improving safety standards and augmenting 

plant capacity.
 
Durgapur Plant
 also achieved healthy value and volume 
growth of 28% and 15% respectively due to maturation of the 

new businesses acquired during previous year and the current 

year. Company had added a customer in TIER 1 category 
to Auto Major TML during previous year. The sale to this 
Company significantly grew and is a major contributor to the 

growth of the plant. Company expects better growth during 
this year from all the customers of this plant. Company has 

planned major layout changes in the plant to improve overall 

operations. Also, company has planned to initiate drive to 
work for TPM Excellence.

commencement of the GST regime from the end of 1st quarter, 

the effects of these were witnessed by the Material Handling 

Division also in the first half and the business started improving 
from then on.

The Company™s Crates are used in various segments which 
includes Automobile, FMCG, White Goods, Engineering, Retail 
sectors.

it™s valued customers. This business has shown healthy growth 
of 30%. 
 
The Company™s customers are appreciative of the quality of 

the products. 
 
Company™s Crate business has been decreasing in Dairy 

and fruits and vegetables segment. This is mainly due to 

abundant use of reprocessed material by many players in these 

applications. Company is able to participate only where good 
quality products are required. 
THE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED

Injection Moulded Pallet business has achieved volume growth

capacity for Roto Moulded products of this Division.
 
Bottle crates for soft drinks did not perform well. This business 

is mainly dependent on two major soft drink players.

Packaging Products
4.4.1
 
Packaging Films
 
The performance films division was running at full capacity 
last year as well as in the year under review. Therefore there 
was no growth possible in the year under review. 
 
Overall sale was 7454 tons in the year under review vis a vis 

7596 tons in the previous year. The sales in value term dropped 

from 
R 
129.40 Crores to 
R 
125.31 Crores . This was due to fall 
in raw material prices as well as drop in selling price.
 
During the year under review, exports stood at 1659 tons as 

against 1028 tons in corresponding period of previous year. 

The company™s thrust on export resulted in robust growth of 
61 % in volume. This trend will continue with addition of new 
customers in several geographies.
 
The customers of the Company have shown confidence in the 

quality of Company™s films and service. 
 
The division™s sales have been consistent and customer base 

could be maintained by virtue of quality of products & high 

service standards. As the capacity of the division remains fully 

utilised, the division has committed an investment of 
R 
41 
crores to expand its capacity at existing Khopoli unit.. The 

same may go in production in Jan/March 2019 quarter. This 
will increase the capacity by around 5000 Tons per annum.
4.4.2
 
Protective packaging division (PPD) 
 
Protective packaging division (PPD) recorded 16% growth in 
value & 17.5% in volume during the year under review. The 

total sale was 23335 tons against 19853 tons last year
 
Overall packaging business was good during the year under 

review. The de-growth of the business of insulation grade 

cross-linked polyethylene foam has continued, as more 
competitors entered the business during the year. Most of the 
manufacturers are supplying substandard products against 

their own declared specifications. The division has taken up 
a challenge to build quality awareness among the customers 
and approving authorities by several modes of communication. 
This is however a long drawn process. NBR sheet plant has 

commenced production in the first week of April after a delay 

of over 4 months due to delayed supply of equipments. This 

will enhance Company™s product offering for insulation range 
of products. However competition may remain fierce in the 
coming year.
 
Many of the civil projects are getting restarted and it is expected 

that the demand will improve for the DURA range of products 

in the current year. 
 
The market response for the new ranges of products like 

children education toys, sports, health sector, & interiors which 

were launched last year has been encouraging. A wide range 
of interlock mats are now well established in the market. The 
division is also developing sport specific certified interlock 

mats.
 
The division is now an approved vendor of Decathlon, a 

leading global sports goods retailer, for yoga mats. Several 

other products are in the pipeline for approval.
 
The acoustic range of products haven™t picked up as well as 

expected, due to the limited availability of NBR bonded block 

foam and some technical issues related to the other range of 
products. The division is expecting a good growth of business 
of this vertical during the year due to enhanced availability of 

the NBR bonded block foam.
 
Hosur unit I & 2 will be merged alongwith the expansion at 

unit 2 & is expected to go in full production by August 2018. 

Unit 1 operation will then be shut down. The company would 
divest the land & building of this unit thereafter.
 
The production capacity of Kharagpur unit will be enhanced 

by 2600 MTPA during the current year by constructing a new 
building and addition of Cross Linked Foam products.
 
The division is also doing the feasibility study for enhancing 

production capacity at Malanpur.
 
The division has started work at the Jadcherla complex which 

is being set up. Production should start in the last quarter of 

the financial year 2018-19.
 
The division has also decided to establish more fabrication 

facilities including expansion of existing ones at different 

locations to capture high value added fabrication business.
 
The division has also started getting good demand of civil and 

insulation range of products from the middle-east market. 

There would be a significant growth of exports in the coming 
year. Present production capacity of 28,600 tons will increase 
to 38,500 TPA without considering Jadcherla and Malanpur 

expansion.
 
Packaging 
 
Packaging vertical grew by 20.08% in value and 21% in volume 

as against last year. Enhanced productivity & improved quality 

standards have been achieved by re-engineering of existing 
equipment/equipments resulting in growth of business. The 
R & D team is also working on developments of new variants 

of polyethylene foam range of products which are application 

specific.

  THE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED
 
The new bubble plant which was installed last year at Hosur 
unit has been modified for the production of new range of 

composite products which was not possible earlier in any of 
our existing equipments. The Company expects good growth 
in the premium range of products during the year. Business 

of two stage block foam which was sluggish over the past few 

years is now picking up and it is expected that the capacity 
will be well utilized in the current year.
 
Business of EVA foam moulded products has not yet started. 
Several products for the sports & health sector have been 

identified & will be launched by the end of 1st quarter. Further 

products would be added in the year.
 
Civil
 
Business grew by 9.18% value and 1.55% by volume in the 

current year. The division has been awarded BIS certification 

for its DURA HD 100 for expansion joint application. Demand 
for DURA range of products is now increasing for the business 
in project based business. To cater the demand, the division 

is planning to expand cross-linked block foamed production 

capacity at various locations. The division is also working 
on development of new range of civil products which are 
application oriented and a cost effective solution to the 

customers.
 
Insulation
 
The growth of Insulation division was 7.29% in value & 3.51% 

in volume. As informed earlier, several new competitors 

entered the business simultaneously & dropped prices 
inappropriately while compromising on desired quality 
standards. This had severely impacted Company™s business & 

profitability. However, constant efforts to sell products based 

on required quality standards has started to yield results. NBR 
sheet plant will expand existing portfolio of products in this 
vertical.
 
Technology
 
The Technical team of the division has been working on 

innovative ideas to develop new products, new applications, & 

upgrading of existing processing facilities and other segments. 
The Company™s innovative & light weight products have been 
beneficial to industry & the society at large
 
The Indian Green Building Council ( IGBC ) has certified all of 

Company™s insulation range of products. The division has also 

received 8th Plasticon Award in the category of ﬁInnovation in 

Polymer Waste Management and Recycling Technologyﬂ on 
the bonded block foam.
4.4.3
 
Cross 
L
aminated Film
 
The Business of Cross Laminated film and products had a 
de-growth during the year which witnessed slow down in 
economy in the first half due to roll out of Goods & Service 
Tax (GST). Several new players have also entered this business 

in the country claiming to make similar products like our 

Company. Combination of these two factors have affected the 
volume & margins in this segment of business.
 
Prior to launch of GST on 1st July, 2017 there was lot of 

confusion, particularly amongst the traders, regarding eligibility 
of credit of duties paid on purchase of goods which remained 

in stock on the date of GST implementation. Most of the 
company™s dealers curtailed purchases to maintain stocks at 
a very low level. This adversely impacted sale of company™s 
products during the first quarter of the year which are supposed 

to be the peak months for the sale of tarpaulins. In the GST 

regime, the company™s main product tarpaulin was placed 
initially in the highest rate bracket i.e. 28%. This made the 
product costly to the end users. After lot of representations 

at various forums the GST rate on tarpaulin was reduced 

from 28% to 18% but in the meantime company lost sizeable 

business. Though the sales picked up from September 
onwards, the loss of sales during the first five months could 
not be recouped.
 
There was small growth in the 35GSM Silpoly Liner business. 

The company is promoting this product in newer applications 

with positive response. 
 
As per the prediction of India Meteorological Department 
the 2018 monsoon is expected to be normal brightening 
the chances of recovery in the farm sector & growth in rural 

economy. This may boost the demand for Company™s products, 

most of which find application in agriculture sector.
 
The company is hopeful of getting increased foothold in the 

USA market in the coming years. The company is working on 
developing specialized new applications to increase the size 
of market. The company aims to bringing in new customers 

in its fold in the existing markets & reaching out new markets 

where at present it does not have any presence by show casing 
its products in various international exhibitions.
 
With enhanced capacity at its disposal the company has made 
Cross Line (XL) Bonded Film available in almost all thicknesses. 

This product has superior properties than the normal XF Film 

& enjoys patent protection. The company has now acquired 

all the rights in the patents of Cross Line Bonded Film from 
the technical collaborator. This will bring in lot of savings in 
the royalties in the coming years as the sale of this product is 

expected to grow.
 
In the coming year the thrust will be on developing newer 

applications and entering into several international markets. 
The company has developed many new fabricated products 
apart from Tarpaulin. Due to its superior properties it is 

getting increased acceptance in different applications. The 

company has successfully introduced this product in different 

applications by laminating the film with other substrate.
 
The technical collaborator of the company is working in 
tandem with the prospective customers of Cross Plastic Film 
to perfect the product in all respects. Once the product is 

perfected the company will be putting up plant to manufacture 

this product at its Muvala plant.

Construction Business
 
The company has developed Commercial Premises viz 

ﬁSupreme Chambersﬂ with a view to monetize the land parcel 

where its first own manufacturing unit was functional. The 
building was completed in 2010-2011 and all permissions are 
in place including Occupation Certificate.
 
The aforesaid commercial premises is marvelously designed 

& is having many eco-friendly features, aesthetically design 

green land scape area & the best of infrastructure & utilities.
THE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED

At the beginning of the year total 63,868 sq.ft saleable area 
was available for sale at the said premise. During the year 

under review the company sold 12610 sq ft saleable area at 
an aggregate consideration of 
R 
24.28 Crs. New construction in 
commercial space is minimal. In view of limited availability of 
good office premises and improved sentiments in Commercial 

space market, Company is hopeful to monetize remaining 
premises of about 51,258 sq. ft. saleable area during current 
year.

PG Cylinder
 
Through the year gone by has not been to the expectation 
but all the same now appears to be promising for the current 
financial year.
 
There were some minor technical issues on the cylinders 

supplied by the Company to Korea and Bangladesh. All those 

issues have been resolved and clients have started discussions 

for repeat orders.
 
It is encouraging to note that Bangladesh has been using 

cylinders for last one year and the Company is negotiating to 
supply larger quantities in the current year.
 
Market demands 15.6 and 20 kg. cylinders. Company 

developed the cylinders and got approval from TUV, PESO 
and KGS. In this, a trial lot has been shipped to Korea in 20 

kg. cylinder and the Company expects to have a good volume 

in these sizes since the country being a coastal region faces a 

problem of rusting of steel cylinders. 
 
The much awaited BIS Standards is complete and BIS 16646 

has been published for Type IV composite cylinders. This was 
necessary so that oil market companies can now take effective 
steps to introduce composite cylinders in Indian market.
 
The feedback has been good from Company™s customers for 

it™s cylinders on whatever small quantities supplied by the 

Company to Private Gas Companies in Goa, Belgaum and 

Bengaluru. Company hopes to see better off-take from Indian 
Gas Companies in coming year.
 
Company has acquired 10% business interest in HPC Research 

s.r.o. a start up company focusing on R & D in Composite 
Cylinders in the Czech Republic which will strengthen its R & 

D footprint in the field of Pressure Vessels.

During the year under review despite RBI keeping the policy 
rates under control , there was increase in interest rate scenario 

in India and US FED rates continue to increase ( going up from 
1% to 1.75%), resulting in higher cost for borrowings under 
Buyer™s credit/ Packing credit in foreign currency routes.
 
Now, with the abrupt discontinuance of Letter of Undertakings 

(LOUs) by RBI, availment of low cost working capital credit in 

foreign currency may become difficult.
 
Despite the challenging times, the Company managed to 

reduce its overall finance cost during the year under review, 

on account of (a) Prudent working capital management (b) 

more reliance on low cost commercial papers and low cost 
borrowings from banks, and (c) Judicious and consistent 
hedging policy to mitigate the risk arising out of foreign 

currency fluctuations.
 
Even though, LOUs are now discontinued, Company is 

equipped to adopt alternative routes to continue to avail low 

cost foreign currency borrowings to meet its working capital 
requirements.
 
During the year under review, the Company has not availed any 

fresh loans and it has repaid Term loan installments of 
R 
47.44 
crores. The Company has no plans to increase its borrowings 
level and it is committed to become virtually debt free (except 

for its working capital requirements) in the next year.

Foreign Exchange Risk & Hedging Activity

rate swap.

2.1.
 
Imports/ buyer™s credit finance
  
This exposure is hedged to the extent of at least 50% on a regular basis;

Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Act
We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of The Supreme Industries Limited (ﬁthe Companyﬂ) as of March 
31, 2018 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.
M
anagement™s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The Company™s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over 

financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ﬁICAIﬂ).

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating 

effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company™s policies, the safeguarding of 

its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely 
preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditors™ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company™s internal financial controls over financial reporting based on our audit. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the 
ﬁGuidance Noteﬂ) and the Standards on Auditing, issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the 

extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both applicable to an audit of Internal Financial Controls and, both issued by 

the ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to 

obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting was established and maintained 
and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system over 
financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining 

an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and 

evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the 
auditor™s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company™s 
internal financial controls system over financial reporting.
M
eaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting
A Company™s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 

reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted 
accounting principles. A Company™s internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) 
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the 

assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 

statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being 

made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company™s assets that could have a material effect 
on the financial statements.
Inherent 
L
imitations of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper 

management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections 
of any 
evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial 
control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the 

policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting and such 
internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as at March 31, 2018, based on the internal control over 
financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance 

Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the ICAI.

1.9 below

1.3
 
Use of Estimates and Judgements
 
The preparation of the financial statements requires that the Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 

amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities as at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts 

of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The recognition, measurement, classification or disclosure of an item or 

information in the financial statements is made relying on these estimates.
 
The estimates and judgements used in the preparation of the financial statements are continuously evaluated by the Company 

and are based on historical experience and various other assumptions and factors (including expectations of future events) 
that the 

Company believes to be reasonable under the existing circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Any revision 

to accounting estimates is recognised prospectively in current and future periods.
 
All the assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-current as per the company™s normal operating cycle of twelve 

months and other criteria set out in Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013.
1.4
 
Property, Plant And Equipment & Intangible Assets
 
Property, Plant and Equipment 
 
Freehold land is carried at historical cost. All other items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated 

depreciation and impairment losses, if any. Costs include freight, import duties, non-refundable purchase taxes and other expenses 

directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. 
 
Leasehold land is stated at historical cost less amounts written off proportionate to expired lease period.
 
Intangible Assets
 
Intangible assets are held on the balance sheet at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Intangible assets developed 
or acquired with finite useful life are amortized on straight line basis over the useful life as specified below: 
 
Capital Work-in-progress and Pre-operative Expenses during Construction Period
 
Capital Work-in-Progress includes expenditure during construction period incurred on projects under implementation treated as 
pre-operative expenses pending allocation to the assets. These expenses are apportioned to the respective fixed assets on their 

completion / commencement of commercial production.

Depreciation/amortisation: 
 
Depreciation is provided on the straight line method applying the useful lives as prescribed in part C of Schedule II to the Companies 
Act, 2013.
 
The range of estimated useful lives of Property, Plant & Equipment™s are as under:
Category
Useful 
L
ife
Buildings (including roads)
 3- 60 Years
Plant & Equipment*
7- 18 Years
Moulds & Dies*
2- 6 Years
Furniture & Fixture
10 Years
Office Equipment
3 - 5 Years
Vehicles
8 - 10 Years
 
* Useful life of Plant & Equipment of Plastic Piping System Division, Protective Packaging Division and Cross Laminated Film Division 

and Moulds and Dies are determined based on the internal assessment supported by independent technical evaluation carried out 

by external valuers.
 
The management believes that the useful life as given above the best represent the period over which the management expects to 
use these assets. The Company reviews the useful lives and residual value at each reporting date.
 
Depreciation on assets added/sold or discarded during the year is being provided on pro-rata basis up to the date on which such 

assets are added/sold or discarded.
 
Leasehold Land is amortized over the period of lease.
 
Assets costing up to 
R 
10,000 each are depreciated fully in the year of purchase.
 
Gains/Losses on disposals/de-recognition of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying 
amount and these are recognized in statement of profit & Loss.
1.5
 
Impairment of Non Financial Assets
 
The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a non-financial asset or a group of non-

financial assets are impaired. If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the amount of impairment loss. For the purpose 

of assessing impairment, the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are lar
gely 

independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets is considered as a cash generating unit. If any such indication 

exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount of the individual asset/cash generating unit is made.
 
An impairment loss is calculated as the difference between an asset™s carrying amount and recoverable amount. Losses are recognised 

in profit or loss and reflected in an allowance account. When the Company considers that there are no realistic prospects of recovery 
of the asset, the relevant amounts are written off. If the amount of impairment loss subsequently decreases and the decrease can 
be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, then the previously recognised impairment 
loss is 
reversed through profit or loss.
1.6
 
Revenue Recognition
 
Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefit will flow to the Company and the revenue can 
be 
measured reliably. 
 
Sale of goods:
 
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred 

to the buyer either at the time of dispatch or delivery or when the risk of loss transfers. Export sales are recognized based on the 

shipped on board date as per bill of lading, which is when substantial risks and rewards of ownership are passed to the customers.
 
Revenue from sale of goods is net of taxes and recovery of charges collected from customers like transport, packing etc. 
Provision is 

made for returns when appropriate. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable and is net of price 

discounts, allowance for volume rebates and similar items.
 
Claims / Refunds not ascertainable with reasonable certainty are accounted for, on final settlement and are recognized as revenue 
on certainty of receipt on prudent basis.
 
Rendering of services:
 
Revenue from sale of services are recognized when the services are rendered.

Other Income 
 
Dividend income on investments is recognised when the right to receive dividend is established.
 
Interest income is recognized on a time proportionate basis taking into account the amounts invested and the rate of interest. For 
all financial instruments measured at amortised cost, interest income is recorded using the Effective interest rate method to the net 

carrying amount of the financial assets.
1.7
 
Government Grants
 
Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attached conditions 

will be complied with. 
 
Government grants related to revenue are recognised on a systematic basis in the statement of profit and loss over the periods 
necessary to match them with the related costs which they are intended to compensate. Such grants are deducted in reporting the 
related expense. When the grant relates to an asset, it is recognized as income over the expected useful life of the asset.
 
In case a non-monetary asset is given free of cost it is recognised at a fair value. When loan or similar assistance are 
provided by 

government or related institutions, with an interest rate below the current applicable market rate, the effect of this favorable interest 

is recognized as government grant. The loan or assistance is initially recognized and measured at fair value and the 
government grant 
is measured as the difference between the initial carrying value of the loan and the proceeds received.
1.8
 
Inventories
 
Inventories includes Raw Material, Work-in-Progress, Finished goods, Stores & spares , Consumables, Packing Materials, Goods for 
resale and commercial premises are valued at lower of cost and net realizable value.
 
Costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition are accounted for as follows:
 
Raw 
M
aterial and Components Œ 
Cost include cost of purchases and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present 

location and condition. Cost is determined using identified lot basis / First in first out (FIFO) basis.
 
Finished/Semi-Finished Goods Œ
 cost includes cost of direct material, labor, other direct cost and a proportion of fixed manufacturing 

overheads allocated based on the normal operating capacity but excluding borrowing costs. Cost is determined on weighted 
average 

cost basis 
 
Stores, Spare Parts, Consumables, Packing 
M
aterials etc. Œ
 cost is determined on FIFO basis.
 
Goods for Resale Œ 
cost is determined on FIFO basis 
 
Commercial Premises Œ
 Cost includes cost of land, premium for development rights, construction cost, materials, services and 

allocated interest and expenses incidental to the construction business.
 
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated cost of completion and the 
estimated costs necessary to make the sale. 
 
Adequate allowance is made for obsolete and slow moving items.
1.9
 
Financial Instruments
 
Financial assets - Initial recognition
 
Financial assets are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments. Financial assets 
other than trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value 

through profit or loss. Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction 

costs are expensed in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
 
Subsequent measurement
 
Financial assets, other than equity instruments, are subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive 

income or fair value through profit or loss on the basis of both:
(a)
 
the entity™s business model for managing the financial assets and 
(b)
 
the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.
 
(a)
 M
easured at amortised cost:
 
A financial asset is measured at amortised cost, if it is held under the hold to collect business model i.e. held with an objective 
of holding the assets to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest 
on the principal outstanding. Amortised cost is calculated using the effective interest rate (ﬁEIRﬂ) method by taking into account 
st
 March, 2018
THE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED  
  
81
any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included 
in interest income in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the Statement of 

Profit and Loss. On derecognition, gain or loss, if any, is recognised to Statement of Profit and Loss.
 
(b)
 M
easured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI):
 
A financial asset is measured at FVOCI, if it is held under the hold to collect and sell business model i.e. held with an 
objective 

to collect contractual cash flows and selling such financial asset and the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal 

and interest on the principal outstanding. It is subsequently measured at fair value with fair value movements recognised in the 

OCI, except for interest income which recognised using EIR method. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss. On derecognition, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the OCI is reclassified from the 
equity to Statement of Profit and Loss.
 
(c)
 M
easured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTP
L
):
 
Investment in financial asset other than equity instrument, not measured at either amortised cost or FVOCI is measured at FVTPL
. 
Such financial assets are measured at fair value with all changes in fair value, including interest income and dividend income 
if 

any, recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 
 
Equity Instruments:
 
All investments in equity instruments classified under financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Equity instruments 
which are held for trading are measured at FVTPL. 
 
For all other equity instruments, the Company may, on initial recognition, irrevocably elect to measure the same either at FVOCI or 
FVTPL. The Company makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Fair value changes on an equity instrument shall 

be recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss unless the Company has elected to measure such instrument at FVOCI. Fair value 

changes excluding dividends, on an equity instrument measured at FVOCI are recognised in the OCI. Amounts recognised in Other 

Comprehensive Income (OCI) are not subsequently transferred to Statement of Profit and Loss. Dividend income on the investments 

in equity instruments are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss.
 
Impairment 
 
The Company recognises a loss allowance for Expected Credit Losses (ECL) on financial assets that are measured at amortised cos
t and 

at FVOCI. The credit loss is difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to an entity in accordance with the contract 

and all the cash flows that the entity expects to receive (i.e. all cash shortfalls), discounted at the original effective interest rate. This is 

assessed on an individual or collective basis after considering all reasonable and supportable including that which is forward-looking. 
 
The Company™s trade receivables or contract revenue receivables do not contain significant financing component and loss allowance 

on trade receivables is measured at an amount equal to life time expected losses i.e. expected cash shortfall, being simplified approach 

for recognition of impairment loss allowance. 
 
Under simplified approach, the Company does not track changes in credit risk. Rather it recognizes impairment loss allowance 

based on the lifetime ECL at each reporting date right from its initial recognition. The Company uses a provision matrix to determine 

impairment loss allowance on the portfolio of trade receivables. 
 
The provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivable and is adjusted 

for forward looking estimates. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-

looking estimates are analysed.
 
For financial assets other than trade receivables, the Company recognises 12Œmonth expected credit losses for all originated or 
acquired financial assets if at the reporting date the credit risk of the financial asset has not increased significantly since its initial 
recognition. The expected credit losses are measured as lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on financial asset increases 
significantly since its initial recognition. If, in a subsequent period, credit quality of the instrument improves such that there is no 

longer significant increase in credit risks since initial recognition, then the Company reverts to recognizing impairment loss allowance 

based on 12 months ECL.
 
The impairment losses and reversals are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss. For equity instruments and financial assets 

measured at FVTPL, there is no requirement for impairment testing.
 
De-recognition
 
The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers 

rights to receive cash flows from an asset, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When 

it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the 

Company continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the Company™s continuing involvement. In that case, the 

Company also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects 

the rights and obligations that the Company has retained.

Financial 
L
iabilities
 
Initial Recognition and measurement 
 
Financial liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments. Financial 
liabilities are initially recognised at fair value net of transaction costs for all financial liabilities not carried at fair value through profit 
or loss. 
 
The Company™s financial liabilities includes trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts and derivative 

instruments.
 
Subsequent measurement
 
Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost are subsequently measured at using EIR method. Financial liabilities carried at fair 

value through profit or loss are measured at fair value with all changes in fair value recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
 
L
oans & Borrowings:
 
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using EIR method. Gains 

and losses are recognized in profit & loss when the liabilities are derecognized as well as through EIR amortization process.
 
Financial Guarantee Contracts
 
Financial guarantee contracts issued by the Company are those contracts that requires a payment to be made or to reimburse the 
holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtors fails to make payment when due in accordance with the term of a debt 
instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are recognized initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are 
directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. 
 
Subsequently the liability is measured at the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined as per impairment requirements of 

Ind AS 109 and the amount recognized less cumulative adjustments.
 
De-recognition
 
A financial liability is de-recognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing 

financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are 

substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition 

of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
 
Derivative financial instruments & hedge accounting
 
The Company uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, cross currency 

interest risk swap to hedge its foreign currency risks. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair 
value on 

the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value, with changes in fair value 

recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial 

liabilities when the fair value is negative.
 
The Company designates their derivatives as hedges of foreign currency risk associated with the cash flows of highly probable forecast 
transactions and variable interest rate risks associated with the borrowings.
 
The Company documents at the inception of hedging transaction the economic relationship between hedging instruments and 

hedged items including whether the hedging instrument is expected to offset cash flow of hedged items. The Company documents 
its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transaction at the inception of each hedge relationship.
 
Cash flows hedge that qualify for the hedge accounting
 
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to statement of profit & loss, except for the 
effective portion of cash flow hedge which is recognized in other comprehensive income and presented as separate component of 

equity which is later reclassified to statement of profit & loss when the hedge item affects profit & loss.
 
Offsetting of financial instruments
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the Balance Sheet if there is a currently enforceable 

legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities 

simultaneously.
1.10
 
Fair Value 
M
easurement:
 
The Group measures financial instruments, such as, derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet date.
 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 

participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the 
asset 

or transfer the liability takes place either:

st
 March, 2018
THE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED  
  
83
 
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group.
 
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset 
or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
 
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant™s ability to generate economic benefits by 

using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best 
use.
 
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure 
fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
 
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within 
the fair value 

hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

indirectly observable

 
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers 
have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the 
fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
 
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, 

characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.
1.11
 
Employee Benefits
 
The Company has provides following post-employment plans:
(a)
 
Defined benefit plans such a gratuity and
(b)
 
Defined contribution plans such as Provident fund & Superannuation fund
 
a)
 
Defined-benefit plan:
 
The liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit gratuity plan is the present value of defined 
benefit obligations at the end of the reporting period less fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligations is calculated 

annually by actuaries through actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method.
 
The Company recognises the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation as an expense in the statement of profit 

and loss:
(a)
 
Service costs comprising current service costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailment and non-routine settlements; 
and 
(b)
 
Net interest expense or income
 
The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation and fair 

value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee benefit expenses in the statement of the profit & loss.
 
Re-measurement comprising of actuarial gains and losses arising from 
(a)
 
Re-measurement of Actuarial(gains)/losses
(b)
 
Return on plan assets, excluding amount recognized in effect of asset ceiling
(c)
 
Re-measurement arising because of change in effect of asset ceiling
 
are recognised in the period in which they occur directly in Other comprehensive income. Re-measurement are not reclassified 
to profit or loss in subsequent periods.
 
Ind AS 19 requires the exercise of judgment in relation to various assumptions including future pay rises, inflation and discount 

rates and employee and pensioner demographics. The Company determines the assumptions in conjunction with its actuaries, and 

believes these assumptions to be in line with best practice, but the application of different assumptions could have a significant 

effect on the amounts reflected in the income statement, other comprehensive income and balance sheet. There may be also 

interdependency between some of the assumptions.
 
b)
 
Defined-contribution plan:
 
Under defined contribution plans, provident fund, the Company pays pre-defined amounts to separate funds and does not have 

any legal or informal obligation to pay additional sums. Defined Contribution plan comprise of contributions to the employees™ 

provident fund with the government, superannuation fund and certain state plans like Employees™ State Insurance and Employees™

Pension Scheme. The Company™s payments to the defined contribution plans are recognised as expenses during the period in 
which the employees perform the services that the payment covers.
 
c)
 
Other employee benefits:
(a)
 
Compensated absences which are not expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the 

employee renders the related services are recognised as a liability at the present value of the obligation as at the Balance 

sheet date determined based on an actuarial valuation.
(b)
 
Undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the services rendered by 

employees are recognised during the period when the employee renders the related services. 
 
d)
 
Expenses incurred towards voluntary retirement scheme are charged to the statement of profit and loss as and when incurred. 
 
e)
 
Other benefits comprising of discretionary long service awards are recognized as and when determined.
1.12
 L
eases
 
A lease is classified at the inception date as a finance lease or an operating lease. Leases under which the Company assumes su
bstantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. When acquired, such assets are capitalized at fair value or 
present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease, whichever is lower. Lease payments are apportioned 
between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of 
the liability. Finance charges are recognised in finance costs in the statement of profit and loss
 
Other leases are treated as operating leases, with payments are recognised as expense in the statement of profit & loss on a straight-
line basis over the lease term.
1.13
 
Foreign Currency Transactions
 
a)
 
Initial Recognition
 
Transactions in foreign currency are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Exchange differences 
arising on foreign exchange transactions settled during the year are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss of the year. 
 
b)
 M
easurement of Foreign Currency Items at the Balance Sheet Date
 
Foreign currency monetary items of the Company are restated at the closing exchange rates. Non monetary items are recorded 

at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Exchange differences arising out of these transactions are charged 

to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
1.14
 
Taxes on Income
 
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognized in the statement of profit and loss except to the 

extent it relates to items directly recognized in equity or in other comprehensive income.
 
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit is different from accounting profit due to temporary differences 

between accounting and tax treatments, and due to items that are never taxable or tax deductible. Tax provisions are included in 

current liabilities. Interest and penalties on tax liabilities are provided for in the tax charge. The Company offsets, the current tax 

assets and liabilities (on a year on year basis) where it has a legally enforceable right and where it intends to settle such assets and 

liabilities on a net basis or to realise the assets and liabilities on net basis.
 
Deferred income tax is recognized using the balance sheet approach. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for 

deductible and taxable temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount in 

financial statements. Deferred income tax asset are recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available 

against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized. 

Deferred tax assets are not recognised where it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realised in the future.
 
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 

probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilized. Deferred 

income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or 
the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
 
Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.
 
Minimum Alternative Tax (‚MAT™) credit is recognised as an asset only when and to the extent there is convincing evidence that the 
Company will pay normal income-tax during the specified period. The Company reviews the same at each balance sheet date and 
writes down the carrying amount of MAT credit entitlement to the extent there is no longer convincing evidence to the effect that 

Company will pay normal income-tax during the specified period.
1.15
 
Research and Development Expenditure
 
Research costs are expensed as incurred. Product development costs are expensed as incurred unless technical and commercial 
feasibility of the project is demonstrated, further economic benefits are probable, the Company has an intention and ability to 
complete and use or sell the product and the costs can be measured reliably.

1.16
 
Provisions and Contingencies
 
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated 
reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
 
Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized when the expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract are 
lower 

than the unavoidable costs of meeting the future obligations under the contract.
 
A disclosure for contingent liabilities is made where there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may probably not require 

an outflow of resources or an obligation for which the future outcome cannot be ascertained with reasonable certainty. When there 

is a possible or a present obligation where the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.
1.17
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents
 
Cash and Cash equivalents include cash and Cheque in hand, bank balances, demand deposits with banks and other short-term 

highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash & which are subject to an insignificant risk 
of changes 

in value where original maturity is three months or less.
1.18
 
Cash Flow Statement
 
Cash flows are reported using the indirect method where by the profit before tax is adjusted for the effect of the transactions of a 

non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past and future operating cash receipts or payments and items of income or expenses 

associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the company 

are segregated.
1.19
 
Borrowing Cost
 
General and specific borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets 

are capitalized as a part of Cost of that assets, during the period till all the activities necessary to prepare the Qualifying assets for its 

intended use or sale are complete during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the assets for its intended use

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
 
Ind AS 115, Revenue from Contract with Customers
 
On March 28, 2018, Ministry of Corporate Affairs (ﬁMCAﬂ) has notified the Ind AS 115, Revenue from Contract with Customers 

effective from April 1, 2018. The core principle of the new standard is that an entity should recognize revenue when (or as) the entity 

satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service (ie an asset) to a customer. An asset is transferred when 

(or as) the customer obtains control of that asset. Further the new standard requires enhanced disclosures about the nature, amount, 

timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity™s contracts with customers.
 
Control of an asset refers to the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the asset. 

Control includes the ability to prevent other entities from directing the use of, and obtaining the benefits from, an asset. 
 
Ind AS 21, Foreign currency transactions
 
On March 28, 2018, Ministry of Corporate Affairs (ﬁMCAﬂ) has notified the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment 

Rules, 2018 effective from April 1, 2018 containing Appendix B to Ind AS 21, Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration 

which clarifies the date of the transaction for the purpose of determining the exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related 

asset, expense or income, when an entity has received or paid advance consideration in a foreign currency.

The Company uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation te
chnique:
 
Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
 
Level 2: Other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly 

or indirectly.
 
Level 3: Techniques which use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market 

data.

Financial risk management objectives and policies
 
The Company™s financial risk management is an integral part of how to plan and execute its business strategies. The Company™s 
activity expose it to market risk, liquidity risk , commodity risk and credit risk. In order to minimise any adverse effects on the financial 

performance of the Company, derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency and 

interest rate swaps are entered to hedge certain foreign currency risk exposures to hedge variable interest rate exposures. 
Derivatives 

are used exclusively for hedging purposes and not as trading or speculative instruments. The Company™s financial risk management 

policy is set by the Managing Director and governed by overall direction of Board of Directors of the Company.
 
Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash flows that may result from a change in the 
price of a financial 
instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency exchange

CREDIT RISK
 
Credit risk arises from the possibility that the counter party may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To manage this, 
the Company periodically assess financial reliability of customers, taking into account the financial condition, current 
economic 

trends, and analysis of historical bad debts and ageing of accounts receivable. Individual risk limits are set accordingly.
 
The Company considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of asset and whether there has been a significant 

increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis through each reporting period. To assess whether there is a significant increase in 

credit risk the Company compares the risk of default occurring on asset as at the reporting date with the risk of default as at the 

date of initial recognition. It considers reasonable and supportive forwarding-looking information such as:
i)
 
Actual or expected significant adverse changes in business
ii)
 
Actual or expected significant changes in the operating results of the counter party
iii)
 
Financial or economic conditions that are expected to cause a significant change to the counter party™s ability to meet its 
obligations
iv)
 
Significant increase in credit risk on other financial instruments of the same counter party
 
The company catogarises financial assets based on the assumptions, inputs and factors specific to the class of financial assets 
into High-quality assets, negligible credit risk; Quality assets, low credit risk; Standard assets, moderate credit risk; Substandard 

assets, relatively high credit risk; Low quality assets, very high credit risk; Doubtful assets, credit-impaired.
 
Financial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectations of recovery, such as a debtor failing to engage in a 

repayment plan with the Company. The Company categorises a loan or receivable for write off when a debtor fails to make 

contractual payments greater than one year past due. Where loans or receivables have been written off, the Company continues 

engage in enforcement activity to attempt to recover the receivable due. Where recoveries are made, these are recognized in 

profit or loss.

Assets where there is a high probability of default. 

In general, assets where contractual payments 

are more than 180 days past due are categorised 

as low quality assets. Also includes assets where 

the credit risk of counter-party has increased 

significantly though payments may not be more 

than 180 days past due
Low quality 

assets, very high 

credit risk
Assets are written off when there is no reasonable 

expectation of recovery, such as a debtor 

declaring bankruptcy or failing to engage in a 

repayment plan with the company. The company 

categorises a loan or receivable for write off when 

a debtor fails to make contractual payments 

greater than 365 days past due. Where loans or 

receivables have been written off, the company 

continues to engage in enforcement activity to 

attempt to recover the receivable due. Where 

recoveries are made, these are recognised in 

profit or loss.

Most of the issues of litigation pertaining to Central Excise/Service Tax/Income Tax are based on interpretation of the respective 

Law & Rules thereunder. Management has been opined by its counsel that many of the issues raised by revenue will not be 

sustainable in law as they are covered by judgments of respective judicial authorities which supports its contention. As such 
no 

material impact on the financials of the Company is envisaged. 
b)
 
Sales Tax and Entry Tax related litigation/demand primarily pertains to non- submission of required declaration forms in time due 
to non- receipt of the same from customers and/ or some interpretation related issues. However in most of the cases, required 
documents are being filed and minor impact if any, shall be given in the year of final outcome of respective matter in appeal.
c)
 
Other issues are either in ordinary course of business or not of substantial nature and management is reasonably confident of 
their positive outcome. Management shall deal with them judiciously and provide for appropriately, if any such need arises.

Basis of Accounting
 
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (hereinafter referred 
to as the ‚Ind AS™) as notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting standards) Rules, 2015 and Companies (Indian Accounting 

Standards) Amendments Rules 2016 prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with rule 7 of the Companies 

(Accounts) Rules, 2014 
 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group are prepared and presented on accrual basis and under the historical cost 

convention, except for the following material items that have been measured at fair value as required by the relevant Ind AS:


1.3
 
Use of Estimates and Judgements
 
The preparation of the financial statements requires that the Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 

amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities as at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts 

of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The recognition, measurement, classification or disclosure of an item or 

information in the financial statements is made relying on these estimates.
 
The estimates and judgements used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are continuously evaluated by the 

Group and are based on historical experience and various other assumptions and factors (including expectations of future events) that 

the Group believes to be reasonable under the existing circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Any revision 

to accounting estimates is recognised prospectively in current and future periods.
 
All the assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-current as per the group™s normal operating cycle of twelve months 

and other criteria set out in Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013.
1.4
 
Basis of Prepration of Consolidation Financial Statements
 
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries and associates as at 31 

March 2018. The Parent Company prepares and report its consolidated financial statements in INR (
R
).
 
Subsidiaries:
 
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the group has control. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to 

variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. 

Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has:

st
 March, 2018
THE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED  
  
117
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31
st
 March, 2018
 
The group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more 
of the three elements of controls. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases 
when the group losses control of the subsidiary.
 
Consolidation procedure:
 
Subsidiary:
a)
 
Combine, on line by line basis like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of the parent with those 
of its subsidiaries. For this purpose, income and expenses of the subsidiary are based on the amounts of the assets and liabilities 

recognised in the consolidated financial statements at the acquisition date.
b)
 
Offset (eliminate) the carrying amount of the parent™s investment in each subsidiary and the parent™s portion of equity of 
each 

subsidiary. Business combinations policy explains how to account for any related goodwill.
c)
 
Eliminate in full intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between entities 

of the group (profits or losses resulting from intragroup transactions that are recognised in assets, such as inventory and fixed 

assets, are eliminated in full). Intragroup losses may indicate an impairment that requires recognition in the consolidated fin
ancial 
statements. Ind AS12 Income Taxes applies to temporary differences that arise from the elimination of profits and losses resulting 
from intragroup transactions.
 
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the Company and to the 
non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Company and to the 

non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
 
Consolidated financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in 

similar circumstances. If a member of the group uses accounting policies other than those adopted in the consolidated financial 

statements for like transactions and events in similar circumstances, appropriate adjustments are made to that group member™s 

financial statements in preparing the consolidated financial statements to ensure conformity with the group™s accounting policies.
 
The financial statements of all entities used for the purpose of consolidation are drawn up to same reporting date as that of the 

parent company, i.e., year ended on 31 March. When the end of the reporting period of the parent is different from that of a 

subsidiary, the subsidiary prepares, for consolidation purposes, additional financial information as of the same date as the financial 

statements of the parent to enable the parent to consolidate the financial information of the subsidiary, unless it is impracticable 

to do so.
1.5
 
Goodwill
 
Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is initially recognized at cost at the date of acquisition. After initial recognition, 

goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any.
1.6
 
Investments in Associate
 
Associates are all entities over which the group has significant influences but not control or joint control. This is generally the case 

where the group holds between 20% to 50% of the voting rights or the group has power to participate in the financial and operating 

policy decision of the investee. Investments in associate are accounted for using equity method accounting.
 
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method 
of accounting, except when the investment, or a portion thereof, is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in 
accordance with Ind AS 105. 
 
Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognised in the consolidated balance sheet at cost and adjusted 
thereafter to recognise the Group™s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate. 
 
On acquisition of the investment in an associate, any excess of the cost of the investment over the Group™s share of the net fair 

value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee is recognised as goodwill, which is included within the 
carrying amount 

of the investment. Any excess of the Group™s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities over the cost of the 

investment, after reassessment, is recognised directly in equity as capital reserve in the period in which the investment is acquired.
 
Distributions received from an associate reduce the carrying amount of the investment. Unrealised gains on transactions 
between 
the group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the group™s interest in these entities. Unrealised losses 
are also eliminated unless the transactions provides evidence of an impairment of the assets transferred.
 
When the Group™s share of losses of an associate exceeds the Group™s interest in that associate (which includes any long-term interests 
that, in substance, form part of the Group™s net investment in the associate), the Group discontinues recognising its share of further 
118
  
  THE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED
losses. Additional losses are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made 
payments on behalf of the associate.
1.7
 
Foreign Currency Transactions
 
In preparing the financial statements of each individual group entity, transactions in currencies other than the entity™s functional 
currency (foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each 
reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary 
items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair 

value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
 
Exchange differences on monetary items are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise except for:

nor likely to occur (therefore forming part of the net investment in the foreign operation), which are recognised initially in other 

comprehensive income and reclassified from equity to profit or loss on repayment of the monetary items. 
 
For the purposes of presenting these consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group™s foreign operations are 

translated into Indian Rupees using exchange rates prevailing at the end of each reporting period. Income and expense items are 
translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case 
the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in equity (and attributed to non-controlling interests as appropriate).
 
Om disposal of foreign operations (i.e. a disposal of the Group™s entire interest in a foreign operation, a disposal involving loss of 

control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, or a partial disposal of an interest in a joint arrangement or an associate 

that includes a foreign operation of which the retained interest becomes a financial asset), all of the exchange differences accumulated 

in equity in respect of that operation attributable to the owners of the Group are reclassified to profit or loss.
 
In addition, in relation to a partial disposal of a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation that does not result in the Group losing 
control over the subsidiary, the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences are re-attributed to non-controlling interests 
and are not recognised in profit or loss. For all other partial disposals (i.e. partial disposals of associates or joint arrangements that do 
not result in the Group losing significant influence or joint control), the proportionate share of the accumulated exchange differences 

is reclassified to profit or loss.
1.8
 
Segment Reporting
 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to Chief Operating Decision Maker 

(CODM).
 
The Group has identified its Managing Director as CODM which assesses the operational performance and position of the Group 

and makes strategic decisions.

Notes:
a)
 
Most of the issues of litigation pertaining to Central Excise/Service Tax/Income Tax are based on interpretation of the respective 

Law & Rules thereunder. Management has been opined by its counsel that many of the issues raised by revenue will not be 

sustainable in law as they are covered by judgments of respective judicial authorities which supports its contention. As such no 

material impact on the financials of the Group is envisaged. 
b)
 
Sales Tax and Entry Tax related litigation/demand primarily pertains to non-submission of required declaration forms in time due 

to non-receipt of the same from customers and/ or some interpretation related issues. However in most of the cases, required 

documents are being filed and minor impact if any, shall be given in the year of final outcome of respective matter in appeal.
c)
 
Other issues are either in ordinary course of business or not of substantial nature and management is reasonably confident of 

their positive outcome. Management shall deal with them judiciously and provide for appropriately, if any such need arises.
