Management Discussion and Analysis
1. OVERVIEW
 The various initiatives taken by the Central and State 
Governments have started showing fruitful outcome in the 
year. The focus on construction of affordable houses, effective 

implementation of RERA, Swachha Bharat Mission, Amrut 

Yojana and other infrastructure building activities are enabling 

the Company to grow it™s Plastics Piping System Business.
 The Government announcement to build 100 smart cities is 
also taking shape. It has started in certain cities. It is expected 

that the whole scheme will have bigger role to play to boost 

business in the years to come.
 The initiatives taken up-to-date by the Government are 
gathering momentum. With an expected growth in the 

businesses of several verticals, the Company took steps to put 

new production units and also expand capacity in several of 

it™s existing units. All the investment plans have fructified or 

are fructifying by June 2019 within the planned investment 

and time frame.
 The Company had plans to put new units at Andhra Pradesh 
(AP) and Assam in the beginning of the year 2019. As the 

land negotiation dragged for a long period, the company has 

prioritised to put a Greenfield plant at Orissa. The effective 

actions will be taken in this year on this initiative. The plans 

to put up units at A.P and Assam will follow thereafter.
 The raw material availability was adequate and affordable. 
The PVC prices in the first ten months maintained upward 

bias. Suddenly the prices dropped in March by 12.5% in five 

week times. This resulted in steep inventory loss in the working 

of the Company for the year eroding it™s operating margin to 

some extent.
 The Company is a large convertor of PVC resin. Company 
currently expects that this lower price regime of PVC may 

continue for some time. It will broaden the Company™s 

business volume and also reduce working capital requirements.
 The prices of other Polymers have improved to some extent 
from their lowest level. The Company converts mostly 

commodity plastics where prices have tendency to remain 

volatile. However, for the current year, the Company expects 

Polymer prices to remain affordable. Availability of raw material 

is also going to remain adequate.
 The Government has committed to revisit the GST rates. It™s 
pronounced aim to reduce the number of GST rate slabs 

triggers hope that Company™s product which mostly fall in 

18% slab of GST may go down to a lower level whenever the 

slabs of GST rates are compressed.
 When the GST was introduced it was expected that informal 
sector may graduate faster to move to formal sector. However, 

pace of moving to formal sector by informal players is quite 

slow.
 The Company remains committed to boost it™s value added 
business and to increase it™s export turnover. To boost export 

business , Company participates last year in 20 international 

Exhibitions for it™s various products. This has boosted it™s export 

turnover from $ 16.93 million to $ 23.05 million. Company 

continues to work aggressively to boost it™s export business by 

intensive marketing and making investments in products which 

can generate larger growth in export business.
 In absolute quantum, the value added product turnover has 
also shown quantum jump. The turnover of such products have 

grown to 
1944 crores compared to the turnover of 
1734 
Crores in the year 2017-18.
 In most of its divisions the focus remains to grow the value 
added businesses. Several investments were made and also 

planned in the current year in this target to go on growing 

value added business turnover.

certifications. The process is on and the division expects 

positive results. Exports during the year were 
770 lacs against 
218 lacs in the previous year.

4.4.3
 Cross Laminated Film
 The Business of Cross Laminated Film & Products had a positive 
growth in volume during the year despite stiff competition 

from several players who have entered this business in last 

two years.
 The Company™s main products are Tarpaulins, bags, fumigation 
covers, vermi bed, rainwater harvesting sheets & pond liners. 

With most parts of India facing water crisis the Government 

is focusing on harvesting water. The Government of India has 

doled out many schemes for conservation of water including 

subsidies to farmers for building water ponds. This has resulted 

in increase in demand for Company™s pond liners which is 

available with warranty.
 The new fabricated products developed by the Company 
have been well accepted by the market. The Company has 

developed many products by laminating the XF film with other 

substrates. The Company expects the sale of these fabricated / 

laminated products to grow manifolds during the coming year.
 The Company was earlier selling Reprocess Granules which 
it was unable to reuse. During the year Company has 

manufactured & sold tarpaulins made from own generated 

Reprocess Granules to target the low cost Tarpaulin Segment. 

This product is well accepted in the Market & will give better 

realization, than selling such granules.
 The quality of the product offered by several new players who 
have entered this business is not comparable. To distinguish 

Company™s products from those of competitors the Company 

is promoting products made from Cross Line Bonded Film. 

This film is now available in all the thicknesses & has patent 

protection. The Company is aiming to substantially increase the 

capacity to manufacture these products. The Company now 

owns the patents worldwide & hence there is lot of savings in 

royalties which would have been payable otherwise.
 In USA the Company has tied up with some local players 
to sell the product online on Amazon & through some store 

chains online and offline. The Company is now receiving 

repeat orders from USA customers. The Company is planning 

to showcase its product in exhibitions to be held in South 

East Asia, Latin America, Africa & USA. This will open up 

new markets besides strengthening the existing markets. The 

Company™s Exports have grown by 14% in volume over the 

previous year.
 The Company™s bags are finding more acceptance from 
industrial product makers. The business of bags has gone up 

by 21% in volume in the year compared to previous year.
 The Company™s technical collaborator has now perfected the 
Cross Plastic Film Technology & is in the process of preparing 

drawings of the equipment™s for manufacturing this film. The 

Company intends to place orders for the equipment™s in the 

coming year. The Company has now acquired worldwide rights 

in the patents of newly developed Cross Plastics Technology 

from it™s Collaborator which will bring in lots of savings in the 

years to come.
4.5 Construction Business
 The company has developed Commercial Premises viz 
ﬁSupreme Chambersﬂ with a view to monetize the land parcel 

it held on shifting of its manufacturing activities out of Mumbai. 

The aesthetically designed green building having many eco-

friendly features & infrastructure facilities was completed 

in 2010-2011 with all permissions including Occupation 

Certificate in place.
 At the beginning of the year total 51258 sq ft of saleable area 
was available for Sale at the said premises. During the year 

under review the Company sold 38718 sq ft saleable area at 

an aggregate consideration of 
80.85 crores. Now only 12540 
sq ft remaining area is available for sale.
 The Company is hopeful to monetize the same during the 
current year.

 RBI kept the Key policy rates at elevated levels during majority 
period of the year under review. The Repo rate, was at 6.00% at 

the start of the year touched a high of 6.50% in the December, 

2018 Thereafter the RBI has reduced the Repo Rate by 25 

bps each in February 2019 & in April 2019 aggregating to 

the reduction of 50 bps in their respective monetary review 

meetings. Thus the Repo Rate has been gradually brought 

down to 6.00%presently. The higher rates generally resulted 

in relatively higher cost of borrowing for the working capital 

requirements of the Company.
2. Working Capital Borrowing
2.1. Foreign Currency Borrowing
 After the discontinuation of Letter of Undertakings (LOUs) by 
RBI, availability of low cost Working capital Credit in foreign 
currency (Buyer™s credits) became scarce initially. However, 

the Company has managed to restart availing of Buyer™s credit 

funding, directly from overseas lenders at competitive rates.
2.2. Commercial Papers
 During the year under review, the Company continued to 
place cost effective Commercial Papers (CPs) in the market to 
avail low cost INR funding. However, with the latest guidelines 

from RBI, w.e.f. 1st April, 2019, borrowers will have to avail 

40% (60% w.e.f. 1st July, 2019) of Fund based limits by way of 

Working capital demand loans (WCDL) from Banks. As a result 

the Company™s cost of borrowing is expected to go up, as it 

will have to reduce its exposure to CPs and Buyer™s Credits, 

in favour of costlier WCDLs.)
2.3. Dealers™ financing & Vendor Management.
 The Dealers™ finance facilities extended to the selected Channel 
Partners of the Company has progressed well with more & 
more Channel Partners are interested to get enrolled on the 

Channel Finance Scheme. The total sanctioned limit under the 

scheme was around 
87 crores & the utilization was around 
61 crores at the end of the year.
 The company continues to negotiate favourable credit terms 
with its suppliers for effectively managing its working capital 

requirements.
3. Term Debt
 During the year under review, the Company has repaid its 
entire term debt component amounting to 
15.38 crores and 
has become debt free Company (except for its Working capital 

facilities).
4. CRISIL Rating
 During the year, the Rating for Company™s Short term bank 
facilities was reaffirmed at ﬁCRISIL A1+ﬂ by CRISIL (which is 

highest rating for the Short term instruments).
 CRISIL vide its letter dated 2nd April 2019 has upgraded the 
Rating for Long Term Bank facilities from ﬁCRISIL AA Stableﬂ 

to ﬁCRISIL AA Positive (Outlook Revised from stable and rating 

reaffirmed)ﬂ.
 The outlook revision is driven by improvement in the 
company™s business risk profile led by strengthening presence 

in the domestic market backed by wider distribution network 

and expected increase in number of manufacturing facilities. 

The company has a strong market position across multiple 

segments in the plastic products industry, and high-margin, 

value-added products make a healthy contribution of around 

35% to revenue.
5. Capital Expenditure
5.1. 
Considering optimistic business growth potential, the Company 

has incurred Capital Expenditure (Capex) of 
384 crores, 
during the year under review. The highlights of the Capex

300-350 crores, mainly on the 
following.
a) Putting Moulding shop at Kharagpur complex

b) Establishing capacity to manufacture PVC Pipe System/
HDPE Pipe System/CPVC Pipe System/PEX Piping system 
at Jadcherla

70.44 
crores from the proceeds thereof (2) Relocated all its Plant &

buildings at Hosur unit 1 & realized 
17.41 crores therefrom.
 Moreover the company has also realized 
80.85 crores from 
the Sale of commercial premises at Supreme Chambers.
 In view of the receipt of the above proceeds coupled with 
internal accruals from its operational performance, company™s 

Cash flows average monthly borrowings have been reduced 

by 
70.37 crores inspite of large capital expenditure and 
increased working capital requirement.
 With the steady growth in cash accruals in the medium term 
with moderate Capex of around 
350 to 
400 crores annually 
financial risk profile of the company should remain robust in 

coming years.

is kept open.

the underlying liabilities in the nature of Long Term Loans.

To The Members of
The Supreme Industries Limited
Report on the Audit of Standalone Financial Statements
Opinion

ises 
of Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2019, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement o
f 
Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flow for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of 
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are included the standalone financial statements for the year 

ended on that date audited by the branch auditors of the Company™s 27 manufacturing units located in the India.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements 
give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the Act) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in c
onformity 
with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules, 
2015, as amended, (ﬁInd ASﬂ) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at 

31st March 2019, its profits (including other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our respo
nsibilities 
under those Standards are further described in the 
Auditor™s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
 section of our report. 
We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ind
ia 
(ICAI) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the p
rovisions of 

the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requir
ements 
and the Code of Ethics.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the standalone 
financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significant in our audit of the standalone financial 

statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a 

whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Sr. NoKey Audit Matters
Auditor™s response
1.
Information Technology (IT) Systems and Controls
During the year the Company has implemented SAP, a new 
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) System. The new system 

is fully integrated financial accounting and reporting system.
The implementation of ERP has a risk of loss of integrity of key 
financial data being migrated and elimination of traditional 

controls without replacing them with the new effective 

controls measures, monitoring of IT controls which are relating 

to critical business processes such as purchase, production, 

sales, inventory and including recording of transactions, which 

could lead to financial errors or mis-statements and inaccurate 

financial reporting and also there is risk that automated 

accounting procedures and related IT manual controls might 

not work.
We have accordingly designated this as a focus area in the audit.
Audit procedures performed:

We have performed procedures to ensure the migration of 
financial data between old system and new system.
Our audit approach consisted testing of design and operating 
effectiveness of internal controls and substantive testing 

around the new ERP system. We also performed sufficient 

test of details as a part of our audit.
We have performed the test of details for areas where the 
Management has implemented manual controls during the 

year including the continuing manual controls as at the year 

end.
We have performed the test of controls regarding the 
appropriateness of system access and an effective maker 

and checker system built in the ERP system for proper 

authorizations of transactions and posting of accounting 

entries.
The combination of these tests of controls and procedures 
performed, gave us a sufficient evidence to enable us to rely 

on the operations of ERP system for the purpose of the audit 

of the financial statements.

Industrial Promotion Scheme (IPS) receivables
Other current assets include government grant in the form of 
refund of Sales tax/GST under IPS Scheme of 
6,242 lacs as 
at March 31, 2019 from the states of Maharashtra, Madhya 

Pradesh, West Bengal and Rajasthan as the respective scheme 

notifications were issued by the aforesaid State Governments.
Post GST, the state of west Bengal is yet to notify the IPS scheme 
and accordingly, the Company has not recognized grant, since 

July 2017, in this regard. The amount whereof is presently not 

ascertainable.
Management judgement is involved in assessing the accounting 
for grants and particularly in considering the probability of a 

grant being released and we have accordingly designated this 

as a focus area of the audit.
Audit Procedure performed:
In response to the risk of completeness of the accruals in the 
financial statements:
We have examined the eligibility certificates and obtained a list 
of year wise break- up of the IPS receivables by the Company 

for all the financial years. We had discussed the status of the 

assessment of grants receivable for all the financial years and 

the Management view on the expected time frame by which 

the grants will be released. Additionally, we have considered 

the status of the previous assessments and the adjustments, if 

any, done by the respective concerned authorities.
Based on the procedures performed, those gave us a 
sufficient evidence to conclude that the grants have been 

accounted in terms of the schemes announced by various 

state governments.
Information Other than the Standalone Financial Statements and Auditor™s report thereon
The Company™s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of other information. The Other information comprises the i
nformation 
included in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Board™s Report including Annexures to the Board report, Business responsibi
lity 
Report, Corporate Governance report and Shareholder™s information, but does not include the standalone financial statement and 
our 
auditor™s report thereon.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assur
ance 
conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our knowledge obt
ained 
during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we required to 
report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management and those charged with Governance for the Standalone Financial Statements
The Company™s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these 

standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance (including other comprehensive 

income), changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Ind
ia, 
including the accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act.
This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for s
afeguarding 
of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of app
ropriate 
accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance
 
of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the acco
unting 
records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, the Management is responsible for assessing the Company™s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless man
agement 
either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company™s financial reporting process.
Auditor™s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements are free from material miss
tatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor™s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 
We also:

 design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis

to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our aud
itor™s 
report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our 
opinion. 
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor™s report. However, future events or cond

the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) Planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work and (ii) 

To evaluate the effect of ant identified misstatements in the standalone financial statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and
 
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regardi

independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in 
the 
audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in 
our auditor™s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we 

determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably 
be 
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Other Matters:
We did not audit the financial statements of 27 branches included in the standalone financial statements of the Company whose f
inancial 
statements reflect the total assets of 
283,816 lacs as at March 31, 2019 and total revenue of 
551,657 lacs for the year ended on that 
date. The financial statements of these branches have been audited by the branch auditors whose reports have been furnished to 
us,

of such branch auditors.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assuranc
e 
about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls operated 

effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system 
over 
financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting includ
ed obtaining 
an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and 

evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the 

auditor™s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due 

to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on t
he Company™s 
internal financial controls system over financial reporting.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting
A Company™s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
 the 
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of standalone financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. A Company™s internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and pro
cedures 
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of 

the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 

statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the entity are being made 

only in accordance with authorisations of management; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of 

unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity™s assets that could have a material effect on the standalone financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper 

management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any 

evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial 

control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with 
the 
policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Company has, in all material respects, 

an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were 

operating effectively as at March 31, 2019, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the 
Company 
considering the essential Component of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial 

Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

1. BASIS OF PREPARATION, MEASUREMENT AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
1.1 Basis of Preparation and Measurement
 These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (hereinafter referred to as t
he 
‚Ind AS™) as notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting standards) Rules, 2015 and Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)
 
Amendments Rules 2016 prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013.
 The financial statements are prepared and presented on accrual basis and under the historical cost convention, except for the 
following 
material items that have been measured at fair value as required by the relevant Ind AS:

 note 
1.9 below



 These standalone financial statements are approved for issue by the Company™s Board of Directors on May 07, 2019.
1.2 Use of Estimates and Judgements
 The preparation of the financial statements requires that the Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the rep
orted 
amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities as at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts 
of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The recognition, measurement, classification or disclosure of an item or 

information in the financial statements is made relying on these estimates.
 The estimates and judgements used in the preparation of the financial statements are continuously evaluated and are based on 
historical experience and various other assumptions and factors (including expectations of future events) that the Company beli
eves to 
be reasonable under the existing circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Any revision to accounting es
timates 
is recognised prospectively in current and future periods.
 All the assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-current as per the company™s normal operating cycle of t
welve 
months and other criteria set out in Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013.
 Areas involving critical estimates and Judgements are:
Œ Estimation of Defined benefit obligations
Œ Estimation of Current tax expenses
1.3 Property, Plant and Equipment & Intangible Assets
 Property, Plant and Equipment
 Freehold land is carried at historical cost. All other items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumu
lated 
depreciation and impairment losses, if any. Costs include freight, import duties, non-refundable purchase taxes and other expen
ses 
directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.
 Leasehold land is stated at historical cost less amounts written off proportionate to expired lease period.
 Intangible Assets
 Intangible assets are held on the balance sheet at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Intangible assets developed 
or acquired with finite useful life are amortized on straight line basis over the useful life as specified below:



 Capital Work-in-progress and Pre-operative Expenses during Construction Period
 Capital Work-in-Progress includes project expenditure incurred during construction period on projects under implementation tre
ated 
as pre-operative expenses pending allocation to the assets. These expenses are apportioned to the respective fixed assets on th
eir 
completion / commencement of commercial production.
 Depreciation/amortisation:
 Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method applying the useful lives as prescribed in part C of Schedule II to the C
ompanies 
Act, 2013. The range of estimated useful lives of Property, Plant & Equipment are as under:
Category
Useful Life
Buildings (including roads)
10- 60 Years
Plant & Equipment*
7- 25 Years

 * Useful life of Plant & Equipment of Plastic Piping System Division, Protective Packaging Division and Cross Laminated Film D
ivision 
and Moulds and Dies are determined based on the internal assessment supported by independent technical evaluation carried out 
by external valuers.
 The management believes that the useful life as given above the best represent the period over which the management expects to
 
use these assets. The company reviews the useful lives and residual value at each reporting date.
 Depreciation on assets added/sold or discarded during the year is being provided on pro-rata basis up to the date on which suc
h 
assets are added/sold or discarded. Leasehold Land is amortized over the period of lease.
 Assets costing up to 
10,000 each are depreciated fully in the year of purchase.
 Gains/Losses on disposals/de-recognition of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying 
amount and these are recognized in statement of profit & Loss.
 Assets held for sale
 Non-current assets or disposal groups comprising of assets and liabilities are classified as ‚held for sale™ when all of the f
ollowing 
criteria™s are met:
(i) Decision has been made to sell.

(ii) The assets are available for immediate sale in its present condition.

(iii) The assets are being actively marketed and

(iv) Sale has been agreed or is expected to be concluded within 12 months of the Balance Sheet date.
 Subsequently, such non-current assets and disposal groups classified as ‚held for sale™ are measured at the lower of its carrying value 
and fair value less costs to sell. Non-current assets held for sale are not depreciated or amortised.
1.4 Impairment of Non-Financial Assets
 The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a non-financial asset or a group of n
on-
financial assets are impaired. If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the amount of impairment loss. For the purp
ose 
of assessing impairment, the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are lar
gely 
independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets is considered as a cash generating unit. If any such indi
cation 
exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount of the individual asset/cash generating unit is made.
 An impairment loss is calculated as the difference between an asset™s carrying amount and recoverable amount. Losses are recog
nised 
in profit or loss and reflected in an allowance account. When the Company considers that there are no realistic prospects of re
covery 
of the asset, the relevant amounts are written off. If the amount of impairment loss subsequently decreases and the decrease ca
n 
be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, then the previously recognised impairment loss is 
reversed through profit or loss.
1.5 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 The Company recognizes revenue, whenever control over distinct goods or services is transferred to the customer; i.e. when the
 
customer is able to direct the use of the transferred goods or services and obtains substantially all of the remaining benefits, provided 

a contract with enforceable rights and obligations exists and amongst others collectability of consideration is probable taking into 

account customer™s creditworthiness.
 Revenue is the transaction price the Company expects to be entitled to. In determining the transaction price, the Company cons
iders 
effects of variable consideration, the existence of significant financing contracts, noncash consideration and consideration pa
yable 
to the customer, if any. The Company considers whether there are other promises in the contract that are separate performance 

obligations to which the transaction price needs to be allocated (e.g. warranties etc.).
 Variable Consideration
 If the consideration in a contract includes a variable amount, the company estimates the amount of consideration to which it w
ill 
be entitled to in exchange for transferring goods to the customer. The variable consideration is estimated at contract inception and 

constrained until it is highly probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur once associated uncertainties are resolved. 

Some contracts with the customers provide them with a right to return and volume rebates. The right to return and volume rebate
s 
gives rise to variable consideration.

 The amount of variable consideration is calculated by either using the expected value or the most likely amount depending on w
hich 
is expected to better predict the amount of variable consideration. Consideration is also adjusted for the time value of money 
if the 
period between the transfer of goods or services and the receipt of payment exceeds twelve months and there is a significant fi
nancing 
benefit either to the customer or the Company. If a contract contains more than one distinct good or service, the transaction price is 

allocated to each performance obligation based on relative stand-alone selling prices. If stand-alone selling prices are not ob
servable, 
the Company reasonably estimates those.
 Revenue is recognized for each performance obligation either at a point in time or over time.
 
Sale of goods:
 Revenues are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods passes to the buyer, usually upon either at the 
time of dispatch or delivery. In case of export sale, it is usually recognised based on the shipped-on board date as per bill of lading. 

Revenue from sale of goods is net of taxes and recovery of charges collected from customers like transport, packing etc.
 
Revenues from services:
 Revenues are recognized over time on a straight-line basis or, if the performance pattern is other than 
straight-line, as services are provided/rendered.
 Other Income
 Dividend income on investments is recognised when the right to receive dividend is established.
 Interest income is recognized on a time proportionate basis taking into account the amounts invested and the rate of interest. For 
all financial instruments measured at amortised cost, interest income is recorded using the Effective interest rate method to the net 
carrying amount of the financial assets.
1.6 Contract balances:
 Trade Receivables:
 A receivable represents the Company™s right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional (i.e. only a passage of time is required 
 
before payment of the consideration is due).
 Contract liabilities:
 A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the company has received consider
ation 
(or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. If a customer pays consideration before the company transfer goods an
d 
services to the customer, a contract liability is recognised when the payment is made or the payment is due, whichever is earli
er. 
Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the company performs under the contract.
1.7 Government Grants
 Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received, and all attached conditi
ons 
will be complied with. Government grants related to revenue are recognised on a systematic basis in the statement of profit and loss 

over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs which they are intended to compensate. Such grants are deducted
 
in reporting the related expense. When the grant relates to an asset, it is recognized as income over the expected useful life of the 

asset.
 In case a non-monetary asset is given free of cost it is recognised at a fair value. When loan or similar assistance are provided by 
government or related institutions, with an interest rate below the current applicable market rate, the effect of this favorable interest 

is recognized as government grant. The loan or assistance is initially recognized and measured at fair value and the government grant 

is measured as the difference between the initial carrying value of the loan and the proceeds received.
1.8 Inventories
 Inventories includes Raw Material, Work-in-Progress, finished goods, Stores & spares, Consumables, Packing Materials, Goods fo
r 
resale and commercial premises are valued at lower of cost and net realizable value. Materials in transit is valued at cost incurred till 

date.
 
Raw Material and Components
 Œ Cost include cost of purchases and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present 
location and condition. Cost is determined using moving average and, in some cases, identified lot basis / First in first out (FIFO) basis.
 
Finished/Semi-Finished Goods
 Œ cost includes cost of direct material, labor, other direct cost and a proportion of fixed manufacturing 
overheads allocated based on the normal operating capacity but excluding borrowing costs. Cost is determined on weighted averag
e 
cost basis/moving average cost
 
Stores, Spare Parts, Consumables, Packing Materials etc.
 Œ cost is determined on FIFO basis.
 
Goods for Resale
 Œ cost is determined on FIFO basis.
 
Commercial Premises
 Œ Cost includes cost of land, premium for development rights, construction cost, materials, services and 
allocated interest and expenses incidental to the construction business.

 Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated cost of completion and the 
estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
 Adequate allowance is made for obsolete and slow moving items.
1.9 Financial Instruments
 A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of 
another entity.
 Financial assets - Initial recognition
 Financial assets are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments. Financial a
ssets 
other than trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried
 at fair value 
through profit or loss. Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction 
costs are expensed in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
 Subsequent measurement
 Financial assets, other than equity instruments, are subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other compreh
ensive 
income or fair value through profit or loss on the basis of both:
(a) the entity™s business model for managing the financial assets and

(b) the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.
 (a) Measured at amortised cost:
 A financial asset is measured at amortised cost, if it is held under the hold to collect business model i.e. held with an obje
ctive 
of holding the assets to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and int
erest 
on the principal outstanding. Amortised cost is calculated using the effective interest rate (ﬁEIRﬂ) method by taking into acco
unt 
any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included
 
in interest income in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss. On derecognition, gain or loss, if any, is recognised to Statement of Profit and Loss.
 (b) Measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI):
 A financial asset is measured at FVOCI, if it is held under the hold to collect and sell business model i.e. held with an obje
ctive 
to collect contractual cash flows and selling such financial asset and the contractual cash flows are solely payments of princi
pal 
and interest on the principal outstanding. It is subsequently measured at fair value with fair value movements recognised in th
e 
OCI, except for interest income which recognised using EIR method. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the 

Statement of Profit and Loss. On derecognition, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the OCI is reclassified from t
he 
equity to Statement of Profit and Loss.
 (c) Measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL):
 Investment in financial asset other than equity instrument, not measured at either amortised cost or FVOCI is measured at FVTP
L. 
Such financial assets are measured at fair value with all changes in fair value, including interest income and dividend income 
if 
any, recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
 Equity Instruments:
 All investments in equity instruments classified under financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Equity instru
ments 
which are held for trading are measured at FVTPL.
 For all other equity instruments, the Company may, on initial recognition, irrevocably elect to measure the same either at FVOCI or 
FVTPL. The Company makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Fair value changes on an equity instrument shall 

be recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss unless the Company has elected to measure such instrument at FVOCI. Fair value 

changes excluding dividends, on an equity instrument measured at FVOCI are recognised in the OCI. Amounts recognised in Other 

Comprehensive Income (OCI) are not subsequently transferred to Statement of Profit and Loss. Dividend income on the investments
 
in equity instruments are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss.
 Impairment
 The Company recognises a loss allowance for Expected Credit Losses (ECL) on financial assets that are measured at amortised cost and 
at FVOCI. The credit loss is difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to an entity in accordance with the con
tract 
and all the cash flows that the entity expects to receive (i.e. all cash shortfalls), discounted at the original effective interest rate. This is 

assessed on an individual or collective basis after considering all reasonable and supportable including that which is forward-
looking.

Þ
 nancial statements for the year ended 31
st
 March, 2019
Page 84
THE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED
 The Company™s trade receivables or contract revenue receivables do not contain significant financing Branch and loss allowance on 
trade receivables is measured at an amount equal to life time expected losses i.e. expected cash shortfall, being simplified ap
proach 
for recognition of impairment loss allowance. It recognizes impairment loss allowance based on the lifetime ECL at each reporti
ng 
date right from its initial recognition.
 For financial assets other than trade receivables, the Company recognises 12Œmonth expected credit losses for all originated o
r 
acquired financial assets if at the reporting date the credit risk of the financial asset has not increased significantly since its initial 
recognition. The expected credit losses are measured as lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on financial asset i
ncreases 
significantly since its initial recognition. If, in a subsequent period, credit quality of the instrument improves such that there is no 

longer significant increase in credit risks since initial recognition, then the Company reverts to recognizing impairment loss 
allowance 
based on 12 months ECL.
 Impairment loss allowance including ECL or reversal recognized during the period is recognized as income/ expense in the State
ment 
of Profit and Loss. This amount is reflected under the head ‚other expenses™ in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The impairmen
t 
loss is presented as an allowance in the balance sheet as a reduction from the net carrying amount of the trade- receivable, lo
an, 
deposits and lease receivable respectively.
 De-recognition
 The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers 
rights to receive cash flows from an asset, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When 

it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the 

Company continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the Company™s continuing involvement. In that case, the 

Company also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects 

the rights and obligations that the Company has retained.
 Financial Liabilities
 Initial Recognition and measurement
 Financial liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments. Financ
ial 
liabilities are initially recognised at fair value net of transaction costs for all financial liabilities not carried at fair value through profit 
or loss.
 The Company™s financial liabilities includes trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts and deri
vative 
instruments.
 Subsequent measurement
 Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost are subsequently measured at using EIR method. Financial liabilities carried at fair 
value through profit or loss are measured at fair value with all changes in fair value recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
 Loans & Borrowings
 After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using EIR method. Gains 
and losses are recognized in profit & loss when the liabilities are derecognized as well as through EIR amortization process. A
mortised 
cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. 

The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of profit or loss.
 Financial Guarantee Contracts
 Financial guarantee contracts issued by the Company are those contracts that requires a payment to be made or to reimburse the
 
holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtors fails to make payment when due in accordance with the term of a debt 

instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are recognized initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly 

attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. Subsequently the liability is measured at the higher of the amount of loss allow
ance 
determined as per impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 and the amount recognized less cumulative adjustments.
 De-recognition
 A financial liability is de-recognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an 
existing 
financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are 

substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the reco
gnition 
of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
 Derivative financial instruments & hedge accounting
 The Company uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge its foreign currency ri
sks. 
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into 

and are subsequently remeasured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss. Derivatives are 

carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.

Page 85
THE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED
ANNUAL REPORT 2018-19
 The Company designates their derivatives as hedges of foreign currency risk associated with the cash flows of highly probable 
forecast 
transactions and variable interest rate risks associated with the borrowings.
 The Company documents at the inception of hedging transaction the economic relationship between hedging instruments and 
hedged items including whether the hedging instrument is expected to offset cash flow of hedged items. The Company documents 
its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transaction at the inception of each hedge relationship.
 Cash flows hedge that qualify for the hedge accounting
 Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to statement of profit & loss, except for the 
effective portion of cash flow hedge which is recognized in other comprehensive income and presented as separate Branch of equi
ty 
which is later reclassified to statement of profit & loss when the hedge item affects profit & loss.
 Offsetting of financial instruments
 Financial assets and financial liabilities are off-set, and the net amount is reported in the Balance Sheet if there is a currently enforceable 
legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities 

simultaneously.
1.10
 Fair Value Measurement:
 The Company measures financial instruments, such as, derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet date.
 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the a
sset 
or transfer the liability takes place either:




 The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Company.

 The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset 
or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
 A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant™s ability to generate economic benefits by 
using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best 
use.
 The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to
 
measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
 All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value 
hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:



 or 
indirectly observable

able
 For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers 
have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the 
fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period. For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company 
has 
determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of 

the fair value hierarchy as explained above.
1.11
 Employee Benefits
 The Company has provides following post-employment plans such as:
(a) Defined benefit plans such a gratuity and
(b) Defined contribution plans such as Provident fund & Superannuation fund
 a) Defined-benefit plan:
 The liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit gratuity plan is the present value of def
ined 
benefit obligations at the end of the reporting period less fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligations is calculated 
annually by actuaries through actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method.
Notes to the 
Þ
 nancial statements for the year ended 31
st

Page 86
THE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED
 The Company recognises the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation as an expense in the statement of profit 
and loss:
(a) Service costs 
comprising current service costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailment and non-routine settlem
ents; 
and
(b) Net interest expense or income
 Re-measurement comprising of actuarial gains and losses arising from:
(a) Re-measurement of Actuarial(gains)/losses

(b) Return on plan assets, excluding amount recognized in effect of asset ceiling

(c) Re-measurement arising because of change in effect of asset ceiling
 are recognised in the period in which they occur directly in Other comprehensive income. Re-measurement are not reclassified 
to profit or loss in subsequent periods.
 Ind AS 19 requires the exercise of judgment in relation to various assumptions including future pay rises, inflation and disco
unt 
rates and employee and pensioner demographics. The Company determines the assumptions in conjunction with its actuaries, and 
believes these assumptions to be in line with best practice, but the application of different assumptions could have a signific
ant 
effect on the amounts reflected in the income statement, other comprehensive income and balance sheet. There may be also 

interdependency between some of the assumptions.
 b) Defined-contribution plan:
 Under defined contribution plans, provident fund, the Company pays pre-defined amounts to separate funds and does not have 
any legal or informal obligation to pay additional sums. Defined Contribution plan comprise of contributions to the employees™ 

provident fund with the government, superannuation fund and certain state plans like Employees™ State Insurance and Employees™ 

Pension Scheme. The Company™s payments to the defined contribution plans are recognised as expenses during the period in 

which the employees perform the services that the payment covers.
 c) Other employee benefits:
(a) Compensated absences which are not expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the 
employee renders the related services are recognised as a liability at the present value of the obligation as at the Balance 

sheet date determined based on an actuarial valuation.
(b) Undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the services rendered by 
employees are recognised during the period when the employee renders the related services.
d)
 Expenses incurred towards voluntary retirement scheme are charged to the statement of profit and loss as and when incurred.
e)
 Other benefits comprising of discretionary long service awards are recognized as and when determined.
1.12
 Leases
 A lease is classified at the inception date as a finance lease or an operating lease. Leases under which the Company assumes s
ubstantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. When acquired, such assets are capitalized at fair value or 

present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease, whichever is lower. Lease payments are apportioned 

between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of 

the liability. Finance charges are recognised in finance costs in the statement of profit and loss
 Other leases are treated as operating leases, with payments are recognised as expense in the statement of profit & loss on a s
traight-
line basis over the lease term.
 The determination of whether an arrangement is (or contains) a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the incep
tion 
of the lease. The arrangement is, or contains, a lease if fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or 

assets and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset or assets, even if that right is not explicitly specified in an arrangement.
1.13
 Foreign Currency Transactions
 a) Initial Recognition
 Transactions in foreign currency are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Exchange differe
nces 
arising on foreign exchange transactions settled during the year are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss of the year.
 b) Measurement of Foreign Currency Items at the Balance Sheet Date
Foreign currency monetary items of the Company are restated at the closing exchange rates. Non monetary items are recorded 

at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign

ANNUAL REPORT 2018-19
currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. The gain or loss arising on 
translation of non- monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the ch
ange 
in the fair value of the item. Exchange differences arising out of these transactions are charged to the Statement of Profit an
d 
Loss.
1.14
 Taxes on Income
 Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognized in the statement of profit and loss except to 
the extent it relates to items directly recognized in equity or in other comprehensive income. In this case, the tax expense is also 

recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, as the case may be.
 Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit is different from accounting profit due to temporary diffe
rences 
between accounting and tax treatments, and due to items, that are never taxable or tax deductible. Current tax is measured at t
he 
amount expected to be paid to the tax authorities in accordance with the taxation laws prevailing and applicable for the releva
nt 
assessment year. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax 

regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the 

tax authorities.
 The Company offsets, the current tax assets and liabilities (on a year on year basis) where it has a legally enforceable right and where 
it intends to settle such assets and liabilities on a net basis or to realise the assets and liabilities on net basis.
 Deferred income tax is recognized using the balance sheet approach. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized 
for 
deductible and taxable temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount i
n 
financial statements. Deferred income tax asset are recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be av
ailable 
against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be ut
ilized. 
Deferred tax assets are not recognised where it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realised in the future.
 The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no l
onger 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilized. Deferred 

income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or 

the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
 Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.
 Minimum Alternative Tax (‚MAT™) credit is recognised as an asset only when and to the extent there is convincing evidence that the 
Company will pay normal income-tax during the specified period. The Company reviews the same at each balance sheet date and 
writes down the carrying amount of MAT credit entitlement to the extent there is no longer convincing evidence to the effect th
at 
Company will pay normal income-tax during the specified period.
1.15
 Research and Development Expenditure
 Research costs are expensed as incurred. Product development costs are expensed as incurred unless technical and commercial 
feasibility of the project is demonstrated, further economic benefits are probable, the Company has an intention and ability to
 
complete and use or sell the product and the costs can be measured reliably.
1.16
 Provisions and Contingencies
 A provision is recognised when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past event; it is probable that an outflow 
of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and in respect of which a reliable estimate can be made. These are revi
ewed 
at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.
 A disclosure for a contingent liability is made where there is a possible obligation arising out of past event, the existence of which 
will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control
 
of the Company or a present obligation arising out of past event where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be 

required to settle or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made.
 Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized when the expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract are lo
wer 
than the unavoidable costs of meeting the future obligations under the contract.
 If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, 
the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as 

a finance cost.
1.17
 Cash and Cash Equivalents
 Cash and Cash equivalents include cash and Cheque in hand, bank balances, demand deposits with banks and other short-term 
highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash & which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes 

in value where original maturity is three months or less.

1.18
 Cash Flow Statement
 Cash flows are reported using the indirect method where by the profit before tax is adjusted for the effect of the transactions of a 
non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past and future operating cash receipts or payments and items of income or expens
es 
associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the com
pany 
are segregated.
1.19
 Borrowing Cost
 General and specific borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets 
are capitalized as a part of Cost of that assets, during the period till all the activities necessary to prepare the Qualifying assets for its 

intended use or sale are complete during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the assets for its intended use 

or sale. Qualifying assets are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale.
 Other borrowing costs are recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
1.20
 Earnings Per Share
 Basic EPS is arrived at based on net profit after tax available to equity shareholders to the weighted average number of equity shares 
outstanding during the year. The diluted EPS is calculated on the same basis as basic EPS, after adjusting for the effects of p
otential 
dilutive equity shares unless impact is anti-dilutive.
1.21
 Segment Reporting
 Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to Chief Operating Decision Maker 
(CODM).
 The Company has identified its Managing Director as CODM who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance
 
of the operating segments and makes strategic decisions.
1.22
 Exceptional Items
 When an item of income or expense within profit or loss from ordinary activity is of such size, nature or incidence that their disclosure 
is relevant to explain the performance of the Company for the year, the nature and amount of such items is disclosed as excepti
onal 
items.
1.23
 Cash Dividend
 The Company recognizes a liability to pay dividend when the distribution is authorised and the distribution is no longer at th
e 
discretion of the Company i.e. when the dividend distribution is being approved by the shareholders. A corresponding amount is 

recognized directly in equity.

31 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 The Management assessed that cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables and other current liabilities approx
imate 
their carrying amounts largely due to the short term maturities of these instruments. The fair value of the financial assets and financial 

liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parti
es, 
other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
 
The Company uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation 

technique:
 
Level 1:
 Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
 
Level 2:
 Other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either direct
ly 
or indirectly.
 
Level 3:
 Techniques which use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market 
data.

  Fair value estimation
 For financial instruments measured at fair value in the Balance Sheet, a three level fair value hierarchy is used that reflects the 
significance of inputs used in the measurements. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active
 
markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurem
ents).
 The categories used are as follows:

 The fair value of investments in equity is based on the price quotation at the reporting date derived from quoted market price
s 
in active market. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial 
institutions. Foreign exchange forward contracts are valued using valuation techniques, which employs the use of market 

observable inputs. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing using present value calculations.
32 RISK MANAGEMENT
 Financial risk management objectives and policies
 The Company™s financial risk management is an integral part of how to plan and execute its business strategies. The Company™s 
activity exposes it to market risk, liquidity risk , commodity risk and credit risk. In order to minimise any adverse effects on the financial 
performance of the Company, derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency and 

interest rate swaps are entered to hedge certain foreign currency risk exposures to hedge variable interest rate exposures. Der

are used exclusively for hedging purposes and not as trading or speculative instruments. The Company™s financial risk managemen
t 
policy is set by the Managing Director and governed by overall direction of Board of Directors of the Company.
 Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash flows that may result from a change in the price of a financial 
instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency excha
nge 
rates, equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk 
sensitive financial instruments including investments and deposits , foreign currency receivables, payables and loans and borro
wings.

 A. CREDIT RISK
 Credit risk arises from the possibility that the counter party may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To manage this, 
the Company periodically assess financial reliability of customers, taking into account the financial condition, current econom
ic 
trends, and analysis of historical bad debts and ageing of accounts receivable. Individual risk limits are set accordingly.
 The Company considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of asset and whether there has been a significant 
increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis through each reporting period. To assess whether there is a significant increase in
 
credit risk the Company compares the risk of default occurring on asset as at the reporting date with the risk of default as at the 

date of initial recognition. It considers reasonable and supportive forwarding-looking information such as:
i) Actual or expected significant adverse changes in business

ii) Actual or expected significant changes in the operating results of the counterparty

iii) Financial or economic conditions that are expected to cause a significant change to the counterparty™s ability to meet its
 
obligations
iv) Significant increase in credit risk on other financial instruments of the same counterparty
 The company catogarises financial assets based on the assumptions, inputs and factors specific to the class of financial asset
s 
into High-quality assets, negligible credit risk; Quality assets, low credit risk; Standard assets, moderate credit risk; Subst
andard 
assets, relatively high credit risk; Low quality assets, very high credit risk; Doubtful assets, credit-impaired.
 Financial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectations of recovery, such as a debtor failing to engage in a
 
repayment plan with the Company. The Company categorises a loan or receivable for write off when a debtor fails to make 
contractual payments greater than one year past due. Where loans or receivables have been written off, the Company continues 

engage in enforcement activity to attempt to recover the receivable due. Where recoveries are made, these are recognized in 

profit or loss.

  Exposure to interest rate risk
 The Company is not exposed to significant interest rate risk as at the respective reporting date.
 D. MARKET RISK- FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK.
 The Company operates internationally and portion of the business is transacted in several currencies and consequently the 
Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk through its sales and services in overseas and purchases from overseas suppliers 
in various foreign currencies. Exports of the company are significantly lower in comparison to its imports. Foreign currency 

exchange rate exposure is partly balanced by exports of goods and prudent hedging policy.

 The Company holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency forward to mitigate the risk of changes in exchang
e 
rates on foreign currency exposures. The counterparty for these contracts is generally are banks. These derivative financial 

instruments are valued based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are directly 
or 
indirectly observable in the market place.

 The Company enjoys natural hedge to the extent of: a) Exports effected and b) Inventory held (being sensitive to exchange rate
 
fluctuations). Although the Company believes that these derivatives constitute hedges from a economic prospective, they might 

not qualify for hedge accounting under Ind AS 109.
 E. COMMODITY RISK
 Principal Raw Material for Company™s products is variety of plastic polymers which are primarily Derivatives of Crude Oil. 
Company sources its raw material requirement from across the globe. Domestic market prices are also generally remains in sync 

with international market price scenario.
 Volatility in Crude Oil prices, Currency fluctuation of Rupee vis-à-vis other prominent currencies coupled with demandŒsupply 
scenario in the world market affect the effective price and availability of polymers for the Company. Company effectively manag
es 
deals with availability of material as well as price volatility through:
 1. Widening its sourcing base
 2. Appropriate contracts and commitments

 3. Well planned procurement & inventory strategy and

 4. Prudent hedging policy on foreign currency exposure

 Risk committee of the Company comprising members from Board of Directors and operations has developed and enacted a 
risk management strategy regarding commodity Price risk and its mitigation.

THE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED
Independent Auditors™ Report on Consolidated Financial Statements
To the Members of 
The Supreme Industries Limited
Report on the Audit of Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of The Supreme Industries Limited (ﬁthe Parent Companyﬂ), its foreign sub
sidiary 
and its associates (hereinafter to be referred as ﬁthe Groupﬂ) which comprises of consolidated Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2019, the 
consolidated statement of Profit & Loss (including other comprehensive income), the consolidated Statement of changes in equity and 

the consolidated Statement of cash flow for the year than ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of 
significant 
accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are included the financial statements for the year ended on that date 

audited by the branch auditors of the parent company™s 27 manufacturing units located in the India.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid consolidated fin
ancial 
statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the Act) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view 
in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Group as at 31st March 2019, its 
profits (including other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our respo
nsibilities 
under those Standards are further described in the Auditor™s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial State
ments 
section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chart
ered 
Accountants of India (ICAI) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements 

under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 

these requirements and the Code of Ethics.
We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred 
to in Other Matter paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated 
financial 
statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial 

statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a 

whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Sr. NoKey Audit Matters
Auditor™s response
1.Information Technology (IT) Systems and Controls
During the year the parent company has implemented 
SAP, a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) System. 

The new system is fully integrated financial accounting and 

reporting system.
The implementation of ERP has a risk of loss of integrity 
of key financial data being migrated and elimination of 

traditional controls without replacing them with the new 

effective controls measures, monitoring of IT controls which 

are relating to critical business processes such as purchase, 

production, sales, inventory and including recording of 

transactions, which could lead to financial errors or mis-

statements and inaccurate financial reporting and also there 

is risk that automated accounting procedures and related 

IT manual controls might not work. 
We have accordingly designated this as a focus area in the 
audit.
Audit procedures performed:
We have performed procedures to ensure the migration of financial 
data between old system and new system.
Our audit approach consisted testing of design and operating 
effectiveness of internal controls and substantive testing around 

the new ERP system. We also performed sufficient test of details 

as a part of our audit.
We have performed the test of details for areas where the 
Management has implemented manual controls during the year 

including the continuing manual controls as at the year end.
We have performed the test of controls regarding the appropriateness 
of system access and an effective maker and checker system built in 

the ERP system for proper authorizations of transactions and posting 

of accounting entries.
The combination of these tests of controls and procedures 
performed, gave us a sufficient evidence to enable us to rely on 

the operations of ERP system for the purpose of the audit of the 

consolidated financial statements.
2.Industrial Promotion Scheme (IPS) receivables
Other current assets include government grant in the form of 

refund of Sales tax/GST under IPS Scheme of 
6,242 lacs as 
at March 31, 2019 from the states of Maharashtra, Madhya 

Pradesh, West Bengal and Rajasthan as the respective 

scheme notifications were issued by the aforesaid State 

Governments.
Post GST, the state of West Bengal is yet to notify the 
IPS scheme and accordingly, the Company has not been 

recognized grant, since July 2017, in this regard. The amount 

whereof is presently not ascertainable. 
Audit Procedure performed:
In response to the risk of completeness of the accruals in the 
consolidated financial statements:
We have examined the eligibility certificates and obtained a list of 
year wise break- up of the IPS receivables by the Company for all 

the financial years. We had discussed the status of the assessment 

of grants receivable for all the financial years and the Management 

view on the expected time frame by which the grants will be 

released. Additionally, we have considered the status of the previous 

assessments and the adjustments, if any, done by the respective 

concerned authorities.
Page 113
THE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED
ANNUAL REPORT 2018-19
Sr. NoKey Audit Matters
Auditor™s response
Management judgement is involved in assessing the 
accounting for grants and particularly in considering 

the probability of a grant being released and we have 

accordingly designated this as a focus area of the audit.
Based on the procedures performed, those gave us a sufficient 

evidence to conclude that the grants have been accounted in terms 

of the schemes announced by various state governments.
Information Other than the Consolidated Financial Statements and auditor™s report thereon
The Company™s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of other information. The Other information comprises the i
nformation 
included in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Board™s Report including Annexures to the Board report, Business responsibi
lity 
Report, Corporate Governance report and Shareholder™s information, but does not include the consolidated financial statement and our 

auditor™s report thereon.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of ass
urance 
conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge o
btained 
during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we required to 
report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management for the Consolidated Financial Statements
The Holding Company™s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation 

of these consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated 
financial 
performance (including other comprehensive income), consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group in 

accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the accounting Standards specified under section 133 

of the Act.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting
 
records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds 
and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable 

and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for 

ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolida
ted 
financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have 

been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as a
foresaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Board of Directors of the Companies included in the Group ar
e 
responsible for assessing the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern 

and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operation
s, or 
has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The respective Board of Directors of the Companies included in the Group are also responsible for overseeing the financial repo
rting 
process of the Group.
Auditor™s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from 
material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor™s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level 
of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 
We also:

r, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as 

fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

 BASIS OF PREPARATION, MEASUREMENT AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
1.2 Basis of Preparation and Measurement
 These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (hereinafter ref
erred 
to as the ‚Ind AS™) as notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting standards) Rules, 2015 and Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Amendments Rules 2016 prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013.
 The consolidated financial statements of the Group are prepared and presented on accrual basis and under the historical cost 
convention, except for the following material items that have been measured at fair value as required by the relevant Ind AS:





 These consolidated financial statements are approved for issue by the Company™s Board of Directors on May 07, 2019.
1.3 Use of Estimates and Judgements
 The preparation of the financial statements requires that the Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the rep
orted 
amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities as at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts 
of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The recognition, measurement, classification or disclosure of an item or 

information in the financial statements is made relying on these estimates.
 The estimates and judgements used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are continuously evaluated by th
e 
Group and are based on historical experience and various other assumptions and factors (including expectations of future events) that 

the Group believes to be reasonable under the existing circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Any rev
ision 
to accounting estimates is recognised prospectively in current and future periods.
 All the assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-current as per the group™s normal operating cycle of twelve months 
and other criteria set out in Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013.
1.4 Basis of Preparation of Consolidation Financial Statements
 The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries and associates as at 31 
March 2019. The Parent Company prepares and report its consolidated financial statements in INR (
).
 Subsidiaries:
 Subsidiaries are all entities over which the group has control. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, 
to 
variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the 
investee. 
Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has:

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31
st
 March, 2019
 The group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more 
of the three elements of controls. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the group obtains control over the subsidiary and 
ceases 
when the group losses control of the subsidiary.
 Consolidation procedure:
 Subsidiaries:
a) Combine, on line by line basis like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of the parent with
 those 
of its subsidiaries. For this purpose, income and expenses of the subsidiary are based on the amounts of the assets and liabili
ties 
recognised in the consolidated financial statements at the acquisition date.
b) Offset (eliminate) the carrying amount of the parent™s investment in each subsidiary and the parent™s portion of equity of e
ach 
subsidiary. Business combinations policy explains how to account for any related goodwill.
c) Eliminate in full intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between entities 
of the group (profits or losses resulting from intragroup transactions that are recognised in assets, such as inventory and fix
ed 
assets, are eliminated in full). Intragroup losses may indicate an impairment that requires recognition in the consolidated fin
ancial 
statements. Ind AS12 Income Taxes applies to temporary differences that arise from the elimination of profits and losses result
ing 
from intragroup transactions.
 Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-
controlling interests. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-con
trolling 
interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
 Consolidated financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in sim
ilar 
circumstances. If a member of the group uses accounting policies other than those adopted in the consolidated financial statements for 
like transactions and events in similar circumstances, appropriate adjustments are made to that group member™s financial statem
ents 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements to ensure conformity with the group™s accounting policies.
 The financial statements of all entities used for the purpose of consolidation are drawn up to same reporting date as that of the parent 
company, i.e., year ended on 31 March. When the end of the reporting period of the parent is different from that of a subsidiar
y, 
the subsidiary prepares, for consolidation purposes, additional financial information as of the same date as the financial stat
ements 
of the parent to enable the parent to consolidate the financial information of the subsidiary, unless it is impracticable to do so.
1.5 Goodwill
 Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is initially recognized at cost at the date of acquisition. After initial rec
ognition, 
goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any.
1.6 Investments in Associates
 Associates are all entities over which the group has significant influences but not control or joint control. This is generally the case 
where the group holds between 20% to 50% of the voting rights or the group has power to participate in the financial and operat
ing 
policy decision of the investee. Investments in associate are accounted for using equity method accounting.
 The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method 
of accounting, except when the investment, or a portion thereof, is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in 

accordance with Ind AS 105.
 Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognised in the consolidated balance sheet at cost and a
djusted 
thereafter to recognise the Group™s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate.
 On acquisition of the investment in an associate, any excess of the cost of the investment over the Group™s share of the net f
air 
value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee is recognised as goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount 

of the investment. Any excess of the Group™s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities over the cost of the 

investment, after reassessment, is recognised directly in equity as capital reserve in the period in which the investment is acquired.
 Distributions received from an associate reduce the carrying amount of the investment. Unrealised gains on transactions betwee
n 
the group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the group™s interest in these entities. Unrealised losses 

are also eliminated unless the transactions provides evidence of an impairment of the assets transferred.
 When the Group™s share of losses of an associate exceeds the Group™s interest in that associate (which includes any long-term 
interests 
that, in substance, form part of the Group™s net investment in the associate), the Group discontinues recognising its share of 
further 
losses. Additional losses are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or ma
de 
payments on behalf of the associate.
1.7 Foreign Currency Transactions
 In preparing the financial statements of each individual group entity, transactions in currencies other than the entity™s func
tional 
currency (foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each 

reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-m
onetary 
Page 122
THE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED
items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair 
value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
 Exchange differences on monetary items are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise except for:

ned 
nor likely to occur (therefore forming part of the net investment in the foreign operation), which are recognised initially in 
other 
comprehensive income and reclassified from equity to profit or loss on repayment of the monetary items.
 For the purposes of presenting these consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group™s foreign operations are 
translated into Indian Rupees using exchange rates prevailing at the end of each reporting period. Income and expense items are
 
translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case 

the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other com
prehensive 
income and accumulated in equity (and attributed to non-controlling interests as appropriate).
 On disposal of foreign operations (i.e. a disposal of the Group™s entire interest in a foreign operation, a disposal involving loss of 
control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, or a partial disposal of an interest in a joint arrangement or an 
associate 
that includes a foreign operation of which the retained interest becomes a financial asset), all of the exchange differences ac
cumulated 
in equity in respect of that operation attributable to the owners of the Group are reclassified to profit or loss.
 In addition, in relation to a partial disposal of a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation that does not result in the Group losing 
control over the subsidiary, the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences are re-attributed to non-controlling i
nterests 
and are not recognised in profit or loss. For all other partial disposals (i.e. partial disposals of associates or joint arrangements that do 

not result in the Group losing significant influence or joint control), the proportionate share of the accumulated exchange dif
ferences 
is reclassified to profit or loss.
1.8 Segment Reporting
 Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to Chief Operating Decision Maker 
(CODM).
 The Group has identified its Managing Director as CODM which assesses the operational performance and position of the Group 
and makes strategic decisions.
