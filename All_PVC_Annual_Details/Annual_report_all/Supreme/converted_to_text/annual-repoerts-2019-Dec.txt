Management Discussion and Analysis

OVERVIEW
 
Various initiatives taken by the center and state governments 
have given desired boost to the plastic pipe business. There 
is quantum jump in construction of affordable houses. The 
infrastructure activities comprising supplying drinking water 

and to boost the sewage system have gathered momentum.
 
Naturally all these activities supported by a large range of SKU™s 

in Company™s Plastic Pipe System and launching of additional 
systems have boosted growth in Plastic Pipe Business.
 
At the end of the year i.e. beginning second half of March 
2020 the business was severely affected due to Covid-19 

Pandemic. The Lockdown is now entering Lockdown 4.0. As 
the time passes, the focus of Government is moving to create a 
balance between Health and Safety of the Countrymen while 

keeping eyes to revive the economy back on growth path.
 
Government is taking incremental steps every day in different 
parts of the country to give desired boost to the economy. In 
that direction Government has announced 
r 
20 Lakh Crore 
package which is touching several sectors of the economy 
especially to support underprivileged population of the 
country.
 
With the Country™s preparedness over the last two months 
to prepare to fight against Covid-19 Pandemic which suitably 
supported by this large relief package which is around 10% of 

India™s annual GDP, it is expected that during second quarter 
of the year 2020-21 the economy may start to revive to serve 
the country with a higher growth potential.
 
Considering the bright future prospects, the Company has not 
slowed down its investment plans. The same was however 
delayed due to cease of activities in different parts of the 

country as a result of Lockdown which remains applicable in 
various parts of the country.
 
The Company expects that by September this year the business 
should be returning to normalcy and will move to growth path 
by November.

 FURNITURE
 
Due to lockdown announced by the Government in second 

half of March 2020, the Company™s furniture business of 
March took a severe hit resulting in drop of annual business by 

3% in value terms and 4% in volume terms. The Company™s 
business had grown by 4% in Value terms and 3% in Volume 
terms for 11 months and was expected to grow in same ratio 

had the lockdown not been announced. The overall sales 
of organized players in Plastic Furniture segment has been 
stagnant or infact declined for 11 month period. However, the 

sales of unorganized players continued to grow at local level. 
The Company expects that with it™s range of different types of 
Furniture and brand strength coupled with countrywide reach, 

it will overcome the competition from unorganized players. 
 
The Company started manufacture of Roto Moulded Furniture 

with a limited range at its Kharagpur Roto Moulding Unit during 
the year. The company now manufactures furniture made with 
all three different technologies i.e Injection Moulding, Blow 

Moulding and Roto Moulding. The Company manufactures 
33
furniture made with Injection Moulding at six locations spread 
across the country which are Jadcherla (Telangana), Puducherry 
(UT), Durgapur (West Bengal), Derabassi (Punjab), Gadegaon 
(Maharashtra) & Guwahati (Assam) to effectively cater different 

regions of the country. The manufacturing facility for Blow 
Moulded Furniture as well as Roto Moulded Furniture is at 
Kharagpur (West Bengal). 
 
The Company has been manufacturing Injection Moulded 

Furniture for 29 years and is a market leader in terms of its 
product range & quality. The Company has many firsts to its 
credit, be it in terms of technology, design or application. The 

Company was the first in India to start manufacture of Premium 
Range of Plastic Moulded Furniture using new technologies and 
materials such as Gas Injection Mouding along with Glass Filled 

Polyproplene. This has helped the Company in creating its own 
brand image which is associated with Premium Quality Plastic 
Furniture. With addition of Blow Moulding & Roto Moulding 

technology, the company now is perhaps the only Company 
in Plastic Furniture business in India to offer furniture made 
with three different processes. 
 
The Company™s range of Blow Moulded Tables has been well 

appreciated by various customers for its quality. The sales of 

these products grew by 8% by numbers in this segment. The 

Company now has 19 products in this segment and plans to 
introduce more products in the current year .The Company is 
optimistic about future growth from this segment and would 

look forward to expand its capacity for achieving economies of 
scale. The export potential of this segment is yet to be realized. 
However, the Company is hopeful of making breakthrough in 

exports in coming years. With the overall outlook of various 
countries looking to establish alternate source to China, the 
Company is optimistic of making the breakthrough. 
 
The Company started manufacture of Roto Moulded Furniture 
in Feb 2020 and could supply only small quantity of this range 
is this year. The Company introduced three models and the 

market feedback for these is encouraging. The Company plans 
to increase its product range as well as start manufacture of 
items in large demand at more locations for easy service and 

reducing the freight cost involved in this product line. 
 
The Company introduced total of seventeen new furniture 

models during the year. All the new models introduced during 

the year were well appreciated and the Company hopes to 
get good growth from its new introductions. The Company 
has already committed investments on new furniture moulds 

which will go into production by second half of the year and 
help in growth of business during the year.
 
The Company™s furniture is currently available to its customers 
through nationwide network of 13,000 retailers. The Company 
plans to add another 1500 retailers during the year. The 
Company believes that in the ensuing year, Customers will 

prefer to buy the furniture from nearest stores and avoid travel 
which will help in growth of Company™s business due to its 
vast network of retailers all across the country. The Company 

increased its strength of channel partners from 1045 to 1113 
nos. and continues to increase its presence in unrepresented 
areas.

INDUSTRIAL COMPONENTS
 
After the encouraging first half of FY18-19, from Nov. 18 

onwards, unexpected slump in the demand for both Auto and 
Consumer Durables was witnessed and it lasted through Q4 
of FY18-19. However, country wide sentiment was indicating 

that there would be pick up post General Elections due in 
April-May™19. Based on this expectation, the Division planned 
6% to 8% growth during FY19-20 over FY18-19, both in 

Auto and Appliances sector. However, slow down continued 
without expected recovery in both the segments even after 
General Elections. Slowdown in Auto sector intensified due to 

various Statutory changes in Vehicle Safety Norms, impending 
BSVI implementation resulting in cautious buying, difficulties 
in availing Vehicle loans resulting from NBFC crises, Weak 

Economic sentiments due to various Global and Domestic 
factors. In case of CVs where the company has larger presence as 
TIER 1 supplier, in addition to the above stated factors, demand 

took beating due to Statutory Axle load increase and drastically 
improved Vehicle Turnaround Time ( TAT), a healthy effect of 
GST, allowing seamless Vehicle Movement across the country.
 
On a larger base of FY 18-19 Sales attained because of non-

recurring sizable order from ECIL for EVM sub-assemblies and 
First Quarter revenue from the hived off Khushkhera plant 
coupled with the combination of factors as stated above, the 

Division had to encounter de-growth of 27% and excluding 
these two effects, the de-growth has been about 16%. 
 
Ghiloth plant set up exclusively for one of the major Appliances 
manufacturer completed its first full year of operations. This 
business was shifted from Noida plant. Noida and Ghiloth 
plants put together achieved revenue growth of about 
10%. Noida plant stabilized Cooler production for one 
of its customers with improved Productivity, Quality and 

Operational efficiency. One of the Company™s major customer 
in Appliances sector from Noida plant was discontinued by 
the company as it was showing signs of bankruptcy and that™s 

what happened eventually. Although, this was a necessary 
step, obviously, it affected revenue of the plant for the year 
under review. The WCE Program which was launched for both 

Noida and Ghiloth plants, has started showing improvements 
and will be more visible in the years to come.
 
Division had one rented premises in Greater Noida which had 
been part of Noida Plant administratively. Company undertook 

a major Re-Engineering Exercise codenamed Noida Integration 
Project. Noida plant was completely relayed out with the aim 
to bring operations of both these plants at single location. This 

resulted in better space utilization, effective management 
34
controls, improved layout, clean environment and effective 
cost management. The Company expects good results of this 
action in the future.
 
Since Commercial vehicle segment was severely hit and 
Talegaon plant having more dependence on Commercial 

vehicles, it suffered on revenues considerably. Company™s 
major customer for Pondy plant which manufactures Washing 
machines, encountered de-growth in the segment where 

Company™s presence is sizable. This impacted company™s 
revenue resulting in de-growth of the Division in Puducherry 
plant. Company has undertaken exercise of Business 

Rationalization with this customer which should mitigate risk 
of overdependence on one segment and improve revenues in 
future. Company received ﬁExcellent Business Partner Awardﬂ 

from this customer, a unique recognition given for long and 
sustained mutual business association.
 
Chennai plant has customer base both for Appliance and 

Automotive. One of the major customers stopped manufacturing 
TVs in India and contracted out AC manufacturing to third 

party. These actions from the said customer had adverse 
impact on the revenue of Chennai plant. However, company 
has acquired new businesses from existing customers and 

added couple of new customers. It should bring positive results 

during current and future years. The expansion of the plant 
undertaken last year has been completed in March, 20 and 
became operational. 
 
Durgapur plant is mainly depending on Auto sector. Due 
to sluggish demand from Auto sector throughout the year, 
Division™s business had to suffer de-growth in the revenue.
 
There was a considerable effect on supply chain of some of our 

major customers due to non-availability of few critical materials 
from China which was shut down to contain the spread of 
Covid 19 during February™20 and March™20. Overall revenue of 

the division adversely affected during last quarter due to wide 
spread slump in the economy, supply failures from China and 
nearly half of March month shut due to Covid 19 lock down.
 
Appropriate steps have been taken in all plants to follow right 

protocols and Operational SOPs including Norms for Social 
Distancing, Personal Hygiene, Sanitization, Environmental 
aspects etc. to contain spread of Covid19. Health, Safety and 

Hygiene has been taken on top of agenda.
 
Company has taken drive to rationalize and reorient the 

machine capacities at its various locations to align it with the 

changed Product- Mix. While doing so, the new machines 
and equipment being added are equipped with the latest 
Technology, Energy efficient, designed for Good repeatability 

for better quality and improved productivity. Wherever feasible 
and cost-effective, Automation is being considered to for 
better productivity and quality. All these initiatives will ensure 

enhanced Quality, Productivity, Safety, Energy conservation 
and Cost Optimization. It is helping the Company to negate 
the impact of inflation due to various manufacturing cost 

increases and cost reductions required to be given year on 
year to customers to remain competitive. The various such 
initiatives of the Company would support Environment and 

help Go Green. Continuous focus on employee engagement 
initiatives is helping company to enhance its Human Capital. 
 
Overall rating of the company by its customers meets or exceeds 
their expectations. Company is considered a highly dependable 
and valuable supplier. The Journey towards excellence is being 
cultivated as a culture and will be continuous. 
4.3.2
 Material Handling Products 
 
The footprints of Indian economy right at the beginning of the 

financial year were not encouraging. Most of the sectors of 
economy started the new year with subdued activities. The 
affect was most pronounced in Automobile, Engineering, and 

Consumer durables, Automobiles was also severely affected 
due to some statutory guidelines from Govt. and NBFC 
financial crisis.
 
If the Company divides the year in two halves, the first half has 

been good for material handling products division. Company™s 

MH Division has been growing in both volumes and revenue 
fighting against odds more so when most of the driving sectors 
for material handling division were not performing well.
 
The second half of the year has been disappointing for MHD. 

The effect appeared starting from 3rd quarter for most of the 
product range, The fourth quarter was even worse with the 
onset of COVID-19 and lockdown in March. Consequently, 

MHD ended year with a negative of 4% in volume and a 
negative of 7% in revenue. Industrial crates which are primarily 
demanded from sectors like auto, engineering, appliances, 

FMCG and retail have 2% negative in volume and 8% negative 
in revenue. The same has been with pallets which are used 
for warehousing, storage in industrial, retail and FMCG have 

shown a degrowth of around 4% in volume and 8% in revenue. 
 
Among the gloom, some positive strings have also flared for 

the company as few segments outshined and shown positive 

results. The Fruit and Vegetable (F&V) and Fisheries crates 
segment, even when The Company serves only the quality 
conscious customers and refrain from selling to mass markets 

and mandis abuzzed with recycled crates, have performed well 
F&V crates have particularly been impressive with an increase 
of 1.5 lakhs more units and registered a growth of around 

15% over last year. This performance was also supported by 
introduction of new models.
 
Dairy Crates have also performed reasonably well during the 
year and new model in Dairy crates have shown promise for 

a bigger market volume this year. 
 
The Roto segment has been poor both in crates, dustbins and 

pallets but the injection moulded dustbins models have shown 

positive trends and promise for good results in this year.
 
The bottle crates sold to other than major players have also 

been on the positive side over the last year.
 
There has been a massive disruption in majority of sectors i.e. 

Engineering, Appliances, Automobiles which were catered by 
the Company have lost ground in volumes. More importantly, 
the polymer prices have fallen with almost 15% in prices on 
average over the last year. 
 
Your company is still confident of good surge in business this 
year in fisheries, F&V, retail and FMCG segments even when we 

feel that the first quarter in all possibilities would be consumed 
by the lockdown with less activity.
 
The division has planned to open two new fabrication facilities 
for speedy and timely service to the customers requiring 

customised crates in both South and North regions. New 
injection moulded dustbins models and few new crates models 
have also been planned for introduction.
 
The Management is focussed to increase the customer coverage 

specially in East and North east, Maharasthra and Southern 

India, by filling up the vacancies and further strengthening 
35
network of channel partners by adding new partners in some 
less or unrepresented areas.

Composite LPG Cylinder
 
Company revisited the design and processes with the assistance 

from its consultant in The Czech Republic to overcome the 

minor technical hick ups going unnoticed in the process and 
have updated component design and improved the processes 
following Poka-yoke system not only to have better product 

but also to optimize the costs.
 
The Company™s composite cylinders are also exported to 
Carribean country and its™ clients in Maldives and Somalia have 
appreciated the quality of cylinders and have placed repeat 

orders. Company™s long term customer from Korea continued 
purchasing the cylinders and is making arrangements with retail 
companies for a bigger engagement.
 
The Company is following up with Government and local Oil 

Companies to introduce composite LPG cylinders in domestic 
market.

complaints of Composite cylinders from Bangladesh during 
the financial year. Newly designed product samples sent to 

customer at Bangladesh have been successfully tested and 

meets the required parameters. Company expects good 
business volume from this customer during the current year.

Volume and about 13% growth in Value.
 
The Total sale achieved was 7722 MT as against 6703 MT in 
the last year.
 
Last year™s expansion in capacity at the Company™s existing 
location in Khopoli has supported to overcome the de growth. 
The Company™s CI Flexographic Printing press has given more 

opportunity for the division in several Segments which has led 
to increase sales as well. Both the new equipment™s helped 
Company to deliver better quality of products and to improve 

its lead times due to the increase in flexibility of production 
capabilities. 
 
The addition of lamination unit, has enabled the Division to 
grow in many untapped markets/Industry/Applications. This 
also helped the Company in creating value added products 
to its portfolio. 
 
Exports have also grown at 1451 tons as against 1316 tons in 
the previous year. 
 
There has been some additional demand from Essential Product 
like Dairy Industry & Edible OIL which is the major Driver of 

Growth. The Company remains optimistic in the current year. 
Even though the Lock down will have some impact on overall 
business in first quarter of this year. However, the customer 

base will be sustained and growing due to Company™s quality, 
commitment and service. 
 
The Company expects to achieve volume and value growth in 

this business in the current year due to increase in customer 
base in India and abroad. This has been made possible due 

to increase in the production capacity with improved product 
mix. 
4.4.2
 Protective packaging division (PPD) 
 
PPD has recorded de-growth of about 4% in value and 1% in 
volume during the year under review. The total sale achieved 
25,660 MT against 26,018 MT of last year. Due to outbreak 
of Covid-19 and lockdown, Sale in Feb and March affected. 

The last week of March was a total wash out. If all was ok, we 
would have achieved sale as per last year in value with 3% 
Growth in volume.
 
Jadcherla unit is now ready to start its commercial production 

immediately after the opening up post Covid 19 with an 

EPE plant saleable capacity of 3200 MTPA and ABF saleable 
capacity of 1440 MTPA. Also the division has installed 
conversion equipment for processing of crosslink foam blocks 

and other fabrication equipment to ensure quick services to 
the local customers. In view of the present scenario, we expect 
sales to stabilize in second quarter, but would take time to 

utilize full capacity. 
 
Hosur unit with all its new facilities and expansions, is now 

fully stabilized for smooth operations with projected saleable 
capacities The Division is working on major cost reduction, 
utilization of its cross linked scrap & development of several 

new products. As a result the Company expects an impetus 
to the growth of cross linked foams across the country. It shall 
consider expansions of these products once the Company 

achieves over 90% utilisation. The Company expects to achieve 

this by the last quarter of this financial year.
 
Special initiative was taken during the year for energy 

conservation by using alternate source of power. Major cost 

savings have been achieved during the year by using roof top 
solar panels, windmills & also buying alternate energy at all 
it™s manufacturing locations. 
 
Division is expecting good saving in fuel cost after installation 

of dry steam IBR boiler at Hosur unit as against conventional 
small multiple non IBR boilers. By observing the cost benefits, 
division is considering now to replace the old non IBR boiler 

at Malanpur unit & shall implement the same soon.
 
Protection to environment against plastic wastes is high priority 
for the division. In house R&D team and the technical experts 
are working to develop new technology for converting the 

plastic wastes to application oriented products.

expenditure to build more competitiveness in the market to 
counter local & unorganised players.
 
PACKAGING Œ
 
Packaging vertical had a degrowth 8% in value and 7.1% in 
volume as against last year.
 
While absolute volume of sheets & rolls did not show a decline, 

tonnage growth was negative in view of density reduction 
achieved over the last year.
 
The division has decided to modify the existing single screw 
extruder at Urse with newly developed technology to produce 

low density EPE foam which is in demand in West zone. Due 
to Covid-19 delay, the Company expects this to be in place 
by the end of second quarter.
 
The demand of EVA based skin friendly non-toxic certified 

grade Yoga mat is now increasing against Chinese NBR PVC 
36
Foam Yoga mat. In-house technical team has designed and 
developed several types of mats to meet the requirement of 
different segments.
 
The production of Interlock mat started two years ago, Initially 
it was difficult to compete against Chinese products. R&D team

volume in current year. 
 
BIS certification has helped to capture business in major 
government projects during the year. Dura floor protector 
which was developed by the division by using Silpaulin and EPE 

foam, is growing and expecting further growth in the coming 
year. In many projects, low cost inferior quality products are 
used in expansion joints at cheaper prices. The Company™s 

technical team has developed low cost products to match 
the lower end product of competitors, with better properties. 
Production of new range of floor protection mat has been 
started at Hosur. It is expected to have good business growth 
from this new product in different applications. 
 
INSULATION

volume in the current year. The division has initiated several 
technological steps during the year to overcome market 

competition by introducing low density certified products 
for Insulation application. The division has started supplying 
special grade chemically cross link foam to Railway Coach 

factory, which was developed last year as an import substitute. 
The division has expanded its reach to many small towns. Once 
things open up, the Company expects better business in the 

coming year.
 
Acoustic panel which was developed last year by using XLPE 

waste is slowly picking up in sales. This will help in reduced 

sale of cross linked scrap. 
 
Commercial production of NBR PVC Foam product which was 
started at Malanpur unit is growing well due to superior quality 
against other competitors. By modifying the existing design of 

the equipment, higher productivity of sheet and tube has been 
successfully achieved. The compounding cost has significantly 
dropped by using indigenous materials. It is expected to have 
good business growth during the coming year.

generation single screw extruder of 100 kgs/hr on pilot scale 
which was successfully installed at Hosur and commercial 

production started with better foam quality and higher 
productivity with low density, compared to extruders making 
similar product. Division has decided to modify all its old single 
screw extruders by using this new technology thereby reducing 

density & costs. The division has been given a National award 
by the Ministry of Chemicals & Petrochemicals, for this 
innovation in the category of Innovation in Polymer processing 

machinery & equipments. Indeed a proud moment for the 
divison & the company. Low cost ABF plant was developed by 
it™s technical team through a Chinese vendor by using European 

technology at low cost for Jadcherla unit.
 
COST REDUCTION

cost reduction & increased introduction of new products to 
improve profitability
4.4.3
 CROSS LAMINATED FILM
 
 
The Business of Cross Laminated Film & Products had a de-
growth of 13.11% in volume terms mainly due to significantly 

lower business in the month of March 2020. The nationwide 
lockdown has completely disrupted the demand supply chain.
 
Company™s plants have become operational after a gap of over 
one month. The Government granted partial relaxation from 

lockdown w.e.f. 20th April 2020. However running plant at 
full capacity is still a distant reality due to paucity of workers 
as several workers have left the work place due to prolonged 

lockdown. 
 
The main product of the company i.e tarpaulin is seasonal 

in nature with peak season between March to June. The 

disruption in demand supply chain with movement restrictions 
in place due to COVID-19 pandemic has affected business 
in April 2020. This will have some adverse impact on the 

Company™s business in the first quarter. 
 
The good news is that the demand for company™s product has 
started picking up and is expected to improve further once 
more economic activities are opened during lockdown. The 

Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted a 
normal monsoon in the year 2020 spelling some cheer to the 
agricultural sector amid the COVID-19 lockdown. Agriculture 

is expected to be the bright spot for the country in the year 
2020-21 which augurs well for the Company™s business as the 
Company™s product finds uses in many agriculture applications. 
 
The share of fabricated products is increasing steadily. The 
Company has made improvements in the existing fabricated 
products based on the feedback received from the customers 

and also developed new fabricated products which after 
successful trials will be launched during the current year. 
The products developed by laminating the XF film with other 

substrates has met with a great success in U.K.. The Company 
plans to market these laminated products in other world 
markets and in local market. The Company strongly believes 

that these fabricated / laminated products have great future 
in years to come. 
 
The Company™s tarpaulins made of own generated unusable 
Reprocess Granules meant to target the low cost Tarpaulin 

segment has had the desired results. The company has not sold 
a single kg of reprocess granule during the year under review 
speaks volumes of the interest this product has generated in 

the market. 
37
 
The Company during the year has successfully installed balancing 
equipment to substantially increase the manufacturing capacity 
of Cross Line Bonded Film. With additional capacity in place 
the company can now offer the entire volume of its products 

in Cross Line Bonded Film. Besides being superior in quality 
this film enables the domestic/global market to distinguish the 
Company™s products from look alike products of competitors. 

This product enjoys patent protection. 
 
The Company is working intensively to increase its™ volume 
in world market. There is repeat demand for its products for 
several newer applications in different world markets. The 

Company expects its™ business to grow in world market in the 
years to come.

give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the Act)  in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity 

with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 
2015, as amended, (ﬁInd ASﬂ) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at 31st 
March 2020, its profits (including other comprehensive income),  changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 

143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor™s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone 

financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities 
in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the standalone 
financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significant in our audit of the standalone financial 

statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a 
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Key Audit Matters
Auditor™s response
1.
Inventory Œ existence and valuation
As at March 31, 2020, the Company held inventories of 
r
 89,057 Lakhs. [Also, refer Note no. 1.9  and 11 of the 

standalone financial statements]
Inventories existence and valuation was an audit focus 
area because of nationwide lockdown imposed by the 

Government of India in view of   pandemic coronavirus  
(COVID 19).
As explained by the Management, due to COVID 19 related 
restriction on account of nationwide lockdown, physical 
verification of inventories, lying at various locations as on 
the Balance sheet date and subsequently also till the date 

of this report, couldn™t  be carried out.
We have accordingly designated this as a focus area of 
the audit.
Audit procedures performed:
We have performed following alternative audit procedures over 
inventory existence and valuations.
(a)
 
Ensuring the effectiveness of the design, implementation  and 
maintenance of controls over changes in inventory to determine 
whether the conduct of physical inventory verification at a date  

other than the date of the financial statement is appropriate 
and testing of those controls whether those have operated 
effectively.
(b)
 
Performing procedures to ensure that the changes in inventory 
between the last verification date and date of the Balance sheet 
are properly recorded (Roll forward procedures).
(c)
 
Performing substantive analytical procedures to test the 

correctness of inventory existence and valuation.
(d)
 
Testing of accuracy of inventory reconciliations with the general 
ledgers at period end, including test of reconciling items.
The procedures performed gave us a sufficient evidence to conclude 

about the inventory existence and valuation.
2.
Industrial Promotion Scheme (IPS) receivables
Other current assets include government grant in the 
form of refund of Sales tax/GST under IPS Scheme of 
 
r
 7,929 lakhs as at March 31, 2020 (
r
 6,242 lakhs as at 
March 31, 2019) from the states of Maharashtra, Madhya 
Pradesh, West Bengal and Rajasthan as the respective 
scheme notifications were issued by the aforesaid State 

Governments.
Audit Procedure performed:
In response to the risk of completeness of the accruals in the 
standalone financial statements:
We have examined the eligibility certificates and obtained a list of 
year wise break- up of the IPS receivables by the Company for all 
the financial years.

Sr. No
Key Audit Matters
Auditor™s response
Post GST, the state of west Bengal is yet to notify the IPS 
scheme and accordingly, the Company has not recognized 
grant, since July 2017 the amount whereof is presently not 
ascertainable.
Management judgement is involved in assessing the 
accounting for grants and particularly in considering 

the probability of a grant being released and we have 
accordingly designated this as a focus area of the audit.
We had discussed the status of the assessment of grants receivable 
for all the financial years and the Management view on the expected 
time frame by which the grants will be released.
Additionally, we have considered the status of the previous 
assessments and the adjustments, if any, done by the respective 
concerned authorities.
The procedures performed gave us a sufficient evidence to conclude 
that the grants have been accounted in terms of the schemes 
announced by various state governments.
Information Other than the Standalone Financial Statements and Auditor™s report thereon
The Company™s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of other information. The Other information comprises the information 

included in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Board™s Report including Annexures to the Board report, Business responsibility 
report, Corporate Governance report and Shareholder™s information, but does not include the standalone financial statement and our 
auditor™s report thereon.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our knowledge obtained 
during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we required to 
report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management and those charged with Governance for the Standalone Financial Statements 
The Company™s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these 
standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance (including other comprehensive 
income), changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, 
including the accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act.
This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding 
of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate 
accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance 

of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting 
records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, the Management is responsible for assessing the Company™s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management 
either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 
The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company™s financial reporting process.
Auditor™s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor™s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 
We also:


and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 

circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has 
adequate internal financial control system in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.

obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the entity™s ability 
to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor™s 
report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 

Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor™s report. However, future events or conditions 
may cause the entity to cease to continue as a going concern. 



the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.  
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the standalone financial statements that individually or in aggregate makes it probable 
that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the standalone financial statements may be influenced. We consider 

quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope pf our audit work and in evaluating the results of 
our work and (ii) 
to evaluate the effect of ant identified misstatements in the standalone financial statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and 
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in 
our auditor™s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we 

determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be 
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Other Matter:
We did not audit the financial statements of 24 branches included in the standalone financial statements of the Company whose financial 
statements reflect the total assets of 
r
 283,044 lakhs as at March 31, 2020 (
r
 283,816 lakhs as at March 31, 2019) and total revenue of
 
 
r
 544,220 lakhs for the year ended on that date (
r
 551,657 lakhs for the year ended March 31, 2019). The financial statements of these 
branches have been audited by the 9 branch auditors whose reports have been furnished to us, and our opinion in so far as it 
relates to 

the amounts and disclosures included in respect of these branches, is based solely on the report of such branch auditors.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

Report on the Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 
of the Act
We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of the Supreme Industries Limited (ﬁthe Companyﬂ) as of March 
31, 2020 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.
Management™s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The Board of Directors of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal 

control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential component of internal control stated in 

the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants 

of India (ICAI). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that 

were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company™s policies, the 
safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting 
records, 
and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditors™ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company™s internal financial controls over financial reporting based on our audit. We 

conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the ﬁGuidance 

Noteﬂ) and the Standards on Auditing deemed to be prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act to the extent applicable to an audit 

of internal financial controls, both applicable to an audit of internal financial controls and both issued by the ICAI. Those 
Standards and 

the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls operated 
effectively in all material respects. 
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system over 
financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining 

an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and 

evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the 

auditor™s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due 
to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company™s 
internal financial controls system over financial reporting.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting
A Company™s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 

reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of standalone financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally 

accepted accounting principles. A Company™s internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures 

that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of 

the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the entity are being made 
only in accordance with authorisations of management; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of 

unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity™s assets that could have a material effect on the standalone financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper 

management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections 
of any 

evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial 

control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the 

policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Company has, in all material res
pects, 

an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were 

operating effectively as at March 31, 2020, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company 

considering the essential Component of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial 

Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

Rounding off
 
All amounts disclosed in the financial statements and notes have been rounded off to the nearest lakhs as per the requirement of 

Schedule III, unless otherwise stated.
1.3
 
USE OF ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
 
The preparation of the financial statements requires that the Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 

amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities as at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts 
of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The recognition, measurement, classification or disclosure of an item or 
information in the financial statements is made relying on these estimates.
 
The estimates and judgements used in the preparation of the financial statements are continuously evaluated and are based on 
historical experience and various other assumptions and factors (including expectations of future events) that the Company beli
eves to 
be reasonable under the existing circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Any revision to accounting estimates 

is recognised prospectively in current and future periods.
 
Current and non-current classification
 
All the assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-current as per the company™s normal operating cycle (not exceeding 

twelve months) and other criteria set out in Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT & INTANGIBLE ASSETS
 
Property, Plant and Equipment 
 
Freehold land is carried at historical cost. All other items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated 

depreciation and impairment losses, if any. Costs include freight, import duties, non-refundable purchase taxes and other expenses 
directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. 
 
Subsequent costs are included in the asset™s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable 
that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. 
The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset is derecognized when replaced. All other repairs and 
maintenance are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss during the reporting period in which they are incurred.
 
Leasehold land is stated at historical cost less amounts written off proportionate to expired lease period.
 
Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31
st
 March, 2020

Intangible Assets
 
Intangible assets are held on the balance sheet at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Intangible assets developed 
or acquired with finite useful life are amortized on straight line basis over the useful life as specified below: 
 
 
Computer Software and Licenses Œ 3 to 5 years 
 
 
Right to Use Œ 5 years
 
Capital Work-in-progress and Pre-operative Expenses during Construction Period
 
Capital Work-in-Progress includes expenditure during construction period incurred on projects under implementation treated as 

pre-operative expenses pending allocation to the assets. These expenses are apportioned to the respective fixed assets on their 
completion / commencement of commercial production.
 
Depreciation/amortisation: 
 
Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method applying the useful lives as prescribed in part C of Schedule II to the Companies 
Act, 2013. The range of estimated useful lives of Property, Plant & Equipment™s are as under:
Category
Useful Life
Buildings (including roads)
 3 - 60 Years
Plant & Equipment*
7 - 25 Years
Moulds & Dies*
2 - 6 Years
Furniture & Fixture
10 Years
Office Equipment
3 - 5 Years
Vehicles
8 - 10 Years
 
* Useful life of Plant & Equipment of Plastic Piping System Division, Protective Packaging Division and Cross Laminated Film Division 

and Moulds and Dies are determined based on the internal assessment supported by independent technical evaluation carried out 
by external valuers.
 
The management believes that the useful life as given above the best represent the period over which the management expects to 
use these assets. The company reviews the useful lives and residual value at each reporting date.
 
Depreciation on assets added/sold or discarded during the year is being provided on pro-rata basis up to the date on which such 
assets are added/sold or discarded. Leasehold Land is amortized over the period of lease.
 
Assets costing up to 
r
 10,000 each are depreciated fully in the year of purchase.
 
Gains/Losses on disposals/de-recognition of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying 
amount and these are recognized in statement of profit & Loss.
 
Assets held for sale
 
Non-current assets or disposal groups comprising of assets and liabilities are classified as ‚held for sale™ when all of the following 

criteria™s are met: 
 
(i)
 
decision has been made to sell. 
 
(ii)
 
(the assets are available for immediate sale in its present condition. 
 
(iii)
 
the assets are being actively marketed and
 
(iv)
 
sale has been agreed or is expected to be concluded within 12 months of the Balance Sheet date. 
 
Subsequently, such non-current assets and disposal groups classified as ‚held for sale™ are measured at the lower of its carrying value 

and fair value less costs to sell. Non-current assets held for sale are not depreciated or amortised.
1.5
 
IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS
 
The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a non-financial asset or a group of non-

financial assets are impaired. If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the amount of impairment loss. For the purpose 
of assessing impairment, the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are lar
gely 
independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets is considered as a cash generating unit. If any such indication 

exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount of the individual asset/cash generating unit is made.
 
An impairment loss is calculated as the difference between an asset™s carrying amount and recoverable amount. Losses are recognised 
in profit or loss and reflected in an allowance account. When the Company considers that there are no realistic prospects of recovery 
of the asset, the relevant amounts are written off. If the amount of impairment loss subsequently decreases and the decrease can 

be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, then the previously recognised impairment 
loss is 
reversed through profit or loss.

1.6
 
REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS 
 
The Company recognizes revenue, when or as control over distinct goods or services is transferred to the customer; i.e. when the 
customer is able to direct the use of the transferred goods or services and obtains substantially all of the remaining benefits, provided 
a contract with enforceable rights and obligations exists and amongst others collectability of consideration is probable taking into 
account customer ™s creditworthiness.
 
Revenue is the transaction price the Company expects to be entitled to. In determining the transaction price, the Company considers 
effects of variable consideration, the existence of significant financing contracts, noncash consideration and consideration payable 
to the customer, if any.
 
Variable Consideration
 
If the consideration in a contract includes a variable amount, the company estimates the amount of consideration to which it will 

be entitled to in exchange for transferring goods to the customer. Some contracts with the customers provide them with a right 
to return and volume rebates. The right to return and volume rebates gives rise to variable consideration. The amount of variable 
consideration is calculated by either using the expected value or the most likely amount depending on which is expected to better 

predict the amount of variable consideration. 
 
Sale of goods:
 Revenues are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods passes to the buyer, usually upon either at the 

time of dispatch or delivery. In case of export sale, it is usually recognised based on the shipped-on board date as per bill of lading. 
Revenue from sale of goods is net of taxes and recovery of charges collected from customers like transport, packing etc.
 
Sale of services:
 Revenues are recognized over time on a straight-line basis or, if the performance pattern is other than straight-line, 
as services are provided/rendered. 
 
Other Income 
 
Dividend income on investments is recognised when the right to receive dividend is established.
 
Interest income is recognized on a time proportionate basis taking into account the amounts invested and the rate of interest. For 
all financial instruments measured at amortised cost, interest income is recorded using the Effective interest rate method to the net 
carrying amount of the financial assets.
1.7
 
Contract balances:
 
Trade Receivables:
 
A receivable represents the Company™s right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional (i.e. only a passage of time is required 

before payment of the consideration is due).
 
Contract liabilities: 
 
A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the company has received 
consideration 

(or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. If a customer pays consideration before the company transfer goods and 
services to the customer, a contract liability is recognised when the payment is made or the payment is due, whichever is earlier. 
Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the company performs under the contract.
1.8
 
GOVERNMENT GRANTS
 
Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received, and all attached conditio
ns 

will be complied with. Government grants related to revenue are recognised on a systematic basis in the statement of profit and
 loss 
over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs which they are intended to compensate. Such grants are deducted
 in 
reporting the related expense. When the grant relates to an asset, it is recognized as income over the expected useful life of the asset.
 
In case a non-monetary asset is given free of cost it is recognised at a fair value. When loan or similar assistance are 
provided by 

government or related institutions, with an interest rate below the current applicable market rate, the effect of this favorable interest 
is recognized as government grant. The loan or assistance is initially recognized and measured at fair value and the 
government grant 
is measured as the difference between the initial carrying value of the loan and the proceeds received.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of 
another entity.
 
Financial assets - Initial recognition
 
Financial assets are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments. Financial assets 

other than trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not 
carried at fair value 
through profit or loss. Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction 
costs are expensed in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
 
Subsequent measurement
 
Financial assets, other than equity instruments, are subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive 

income or fair value through profit or loss on the basis of both:
 
(a)
 
the entity™s business model for managing the financial assets and 
 
(b)
 
the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.
 
(a)
 
Measured at amortised cost:
 
A financial asset is measured at amortised cost, if it is held under the hold to collect business model i.e. held with an objective 

of holding the assets to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest 
on the principal outstanding. Amortised cost is calculated using the effective interest rate (ﬁEIRﬂ) method by taking into account 
any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included 

in interest income in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss. On derecognition, gain or loss, if any, is recognised to Statement of Profit and Loss.
 
(b)
 
Measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI):
 
A financial asset is measured at FVOCI, if it is held under the hold to collect and sell business model i.e. held with an 
objective 
to collect contractual cash flows and selling such financial asset and the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal 
and interest on the principal outstanding. It is subsequently measured at fair value with fair value movements recognised in the 
OCI, except for interest income which recognised using EIR method. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the 

Statement of Profit and Loss. On derecognition, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the OCI is reclassified from the 
equity to Statement of Profit and Loss.
 
(c)
 
Measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL):
 
Investment in financial asset other than equity instrument, not measured at either amortised cost or FVOCI is measured at FVTPL
. 
Such financial assets are measured at fair value with all changes in fair value, including interest income and dividend income 
if 
any, recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 
 
Equity Instruments:
 
All investments in equity instruments classified under financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Equity instruments 
which are held for trading are measured at FVTPL. 
 
For all other equity instruments, the Company may, on initial recognition, irrevocably elect to measure the same either at FVOCI or 

FVTPL. The Company makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Fair value changes on an equity instrument shall 

be recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss unless the Company has elected to measure such instrument at FVOCI. Fair value 
changes excluding dividends, on an equity instrument measured at FVOCI are recognised in the OCI. Amounts recognised in Other 
Comprehensive Income (OCI) are not subsequently transferred to Statement of Profit and Loss. Dividend income on the investments 

in equity instruments are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss.

Impairment 
 
The Company recognises a loss allowance for Expected Credit Losses (ECL) on financial assets that are measured at amortised cost and 
at FVOCI. The credit loss is difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to an entity in accordance with the contract 
and all the cash flows that the entity expects to receive (i.e. all cash shortfalls), discounted at the original effective interest rate. This is 
assessed on an individual or collective basis after considering all reasonable and supportable including that which is forward-looking. 
 
The Company™s trade receivables or contract revenue receivables do not contain significant financing Branch and loss allowance on 
trade receivables is measured at an amount equal to life time expected losses i.e. expected cash shortfall, being simplified approach 
for recognition of impairment loss allowance. 
 
Under simplified approach, the Company does not track changes in credit risk. Rather it recognizes impairment loss allowance 

based on the lifetime ECL at each reporting date right from its initial recognition. The Company uses a provision matrix to determine 
impairment loss allowance on the portfolio of trade receivables. 
 
The provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivable and is adjusted 

for forward looking estimates. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-
looking estimates are analysed.
 
For financial assets other than trade receivables, the Company recognises 12Œmonth expected credit losses for all originated or 
acquired financial assets if at the reporting date the credit risk of the financial asset has not increased significantly since its initial 
recognition. The expected credit losses are measured as lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on financial asset increases 

significantly since its initial recognition. If, in a subsequent period, credit quality of the instrument improves such that there is no 
longer significant increase in credit risks since initial recognition, then the Company reverts to recognizing impairment loss allowance 
based on 12 months ECL.
 
Impairment loss allowance including ECL or reversal recognized during the period is recognized as income/ expense in the Statement 

of Profit and Loss. This amount is reflected under the head ‚other expenses™ in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The impairment 

loss is presented as an allowance in the balance sheet as a reduction from the net carrying amount of the trade- receivable, loan, 
deposits and lease receivable respectively.
 
De-recognition
 
The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers 
rights to receive cash flows from an asset, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When 
it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the 
Company continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the Company™s continuing involvement. In that case, the 

Company also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects 
the rights and obligations that the Company has retained.
 
Financial Liabilities
 
Initial Recognition and measurement 
 
Financial liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments. Financial 
liabilities are initially recognised at fair value net of transaction costs for all financial liabilities not carried at fair value through profit 
or loss. 
 
The Company™s financial liabilities includes trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts and derivative 
instruments.
 
Subsequent measurement
 
Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost are subsequently measured at using EIR method. Financial liabilities carried at fair 

value through profit or loss are measured at fair value with all changes in fair value recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
 
Loans & Borrowings
 
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using EIR method. Gains 

and losses are recognized in profit & loss when the liabilities are derecognized as well as through EIR amortization process. Amortised 
cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. 
The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of profit or loss. 
 
Financial Guarantee Contracts
 
Financial guarantee contracts issued by the Company are those contracts that requires a payment to be made or to reimburse the 

holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtors fails to make payment when due in accordance with the term of a debt 
instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are recognized initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly 
attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. Subsequently the liability is measured at the higher of the amount of loss allowance 

determined as per impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 and the amount recognized less cumulative adjustments.

st
 March, 2020
79
 
De-recognition
 
A financial liability is de-recognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing 
financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are 
substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition 
of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
 
Derivative financial instruments & hedge accounting
 
The Company uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge its foreign currency 
risks. 

Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is 
entered into 
and are subsequently remeasured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss. Derivatives are 
carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.
 
The Company designates their derivatives as hedges of foreign currency risk associated with the cash flows of highly probable forecast 

transactions and variable interest rate risks associated with the borrowings.
 
The Company documents at the inception of hedging transaction the economic relationship between hedging instruments and 

hedged items including whether the hedging instrument is expected to offset cash flow of hedged items. The Company documents 
its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transaction at the inception of each hedge relationship.
 
Cash flows hedge that qualify for the hedge accounting
 
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to statement of profit & loss, except for the 
effective portion of cash flow hedge which is recognized in other comprehensive income and presented as separate Branch of equity 
which is later reclassified to statement of profit & loss when the hedge item affects profit & loss.
 
Offsetting of financial instruments
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are off-set, and the net amount is reported in the Balance Sheet if there is a currently enforceable 
legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities 
simultaneously.
1.11
 
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT:
 
The Company measures financial instruments, such as, derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet date.
 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 

participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the 
asset 
or transfer the liability takes place either:
 
 
In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
 
 
In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability
 
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Company.
 
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset 
or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
 
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant™s ability to generate economic benefits by 
using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best 
use.
 
The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to 
measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
 
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within 
the fair value 
hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
 
Level 1 Š Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
 
Level 2 Š Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or 
indirectly observable
 
Level 3 Š Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable
 
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers 

have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the 

fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period. For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company has 
determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability 
and the level of 
the fair value hierarchy as explained above.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
 
The Company has provides following post-employment plans such as:
 
(a)
 
Defined benefit plans such a gratuity and
 
(b)
 
Defined contribution plans such as Provident fund & Superannuation fund
 
a)
 
Defined-benefit plan:
 
The liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit gratuity plan is the present value of defined 
benefit obligations at the end of the reporting period less fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligations is calculated 
annually by actuaries through actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method.
 
The Company recognises the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation as an expense in the statement of profit 

and loss:
(a)
 
Service costs comprising current service costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailment and non-routine settlements; 
and 
(b)
 
Net interest expense or income
  
Re-measurement comprising of actuarial gains and losses arising from:
  
(a)
 
Re-measurement of Actuarial(gains)/losses
  
(b)
 
Return on plan assets, excluding amount recognized in effect of asset ceiling
  
(c)
 
Re-measurement arising because of change in effect of asset ceiling
 
are recognised in the period in which they occur directly in Other comprehensive income. Re-measurement are not reclassified 

to profit or loss in subsequent periods.
 
Ind AS 19 requires the exercise of judgment in relation to various assumptions including future pay rises, inflation and discount 

rates and employee and pensioner demographics. The Company determines the assumptions in conjunction with its actuaries, and 

believes these assumptions to be in line with best practice, but the application of different assumptions could have a significant 
effect on the amounts reflected in the income statement, other comprehensive income and balance sheet. There may be also 
interdependency between some of the assumptions.
 
b)
 
Defined-contribution plan:
 
Under defined contribution plans, provident fund, the Company pays pre-defined amounts to separate funds and does not have 

any legal or informal obligation to pay additional sums. Defined Contribution plan comprise of contributions to the employees™ 
provident fund with the government, superannuation fund and certain state plans like Employees™ State Insurance and Employees™ 
Pension Scheme. The Company™s payments to the defined contribution plans are recognised as expenses during the period in 

which the employees perform the services that the payment covers.
 
c)
 
Other employee benefits:
(a)
 
Compensated absences which are not expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the 

employee renders the related services are recognised as a liability at the present value of the obligation as at the Balance 
sheet date determined based on an actuarial valuation.
(b)
 
Undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the services rendered by 

employees are recognised during the period when the employee renders the related services. 
d)
 
Expenses incurred towards voluntary retirement scheme are charged to the statement of profit and loss as and when incurred. 
e)
 
Other benefits comprising of discretionary long service awards are recognized as and when determined.
1.13
 
LEASES
 
As a Lessee:
 
The Company™s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for land, buildings and vehicles. The Company assesses whether a 
contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the 
use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. 
 
To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether: 
 
(i)
 
the contract involves the use of an identified asset;
 
(ii)
 
the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease; and 
 
(iii)
 
the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. 
 
At the date of commencement of the lease, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset (ﬁROUﬂ) and a corresponding lease liability 
for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low 

value leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a 
straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31
st
 March, 2020
81
 
The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease 
payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are 
subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
 
Certain lease arrangements includes the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets 
and 
lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised. 
 
Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful 

life of the underlying asset. Right of use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher 
of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate 

cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash 
Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. 
 
The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments are 
discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates in the 

country of domicile of these leases. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset 
if the Company changes its assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option. 
 
Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as 
financing cash flows.
 
As a Lessor:
 
Lease income from operating leases where the Company is a lessor is recognised in income on a straight-line basis over the lease 

term unless the receipts are structured to increase in line with expected general inflation to compensate for the expected inflationary 
cost increases. The respective leased assets are included in the balance sheet based on their nature.
1.14
 
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS
 
a)
 
Functional and Presentation currency
  
The Financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (INR), which is Company™s functional and presentation currency.
 
b)
 
Initial Recognition
 
Transactions in foreign currency are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Exchange differences 
arising on foreign exchange transactions settled during the year are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss of the year. 
 
c)
 
Measurement of Foreign Currency Items at the Balance Sheet Date
 
Foreign currency monetary items of the Company are restated at the closing exchange rates. Non monetary items are recorded 

at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign
 
currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. The gain or loss arising on 
translation of non- monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the ch
ange 

in the fair value of the item. Exchange differences arising out of these transactions are charged to the Statement of Profit an
d Loss.
1.15
 
TAXES ON INCOME
 
The income tax expense or credit for the period is the tax payable on the current period™s taxable income based on the applicable 

income tax rate adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax 
losses, if any. 
 
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognized in the statement of profit and loss except to 
the extent it relates to items directly recognized in equity or in other comprehensive income. In this case, the tax expense is also 

recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, as the case may be.
 
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit is different from accounting profit due to temporary differences 

between accounting and tax treatments, and due to items, that are never taxable or tax deductible. Current tax is measured at the 

amount expected to be paid to the tax authorities in accordance with the taxation laws prevailing and applicable for the relevant 

assessment year. 
 
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets 

and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) 
that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related 
deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
 
The Company offsets, the tax assets and liabilities (on a year on year basis) where it has a legally enforceable right and where it intends 
to settle such assets and liabilities on a net basis or to realise the assets and liabilities on net basis.
 
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilized. Deferred 
income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or 
the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31
st
 March, 2020
82
 
Minimum Alternative Tax (‚MAT™) credit is recognised as an asset only when and to the extent there is convincing evidence that the 
Company will pay normal income-tax during the specified period. The Company reviews the same at each balance sheet date and 
writes down the carrying amount of MAT credit entitlement to the extent there is no longer convincing evidence to the effect that 
Company will pay normal income-tax during the specified period.
1.16
 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE
 
Research costs are expensed as incurred. Product development costs are expensed as incurred unless technical and commercial 

feasibility of the project is demonstrated, further economic benefits are probable, the Company has an intention and ability to 
complete and use or sell the product and the costs can be measured reliably.
1.17
 
PROVISIONS AND CONTINGENCIES
 
A provision is recognised when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past event; it is probable that an outflow 
of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and in respect of which a reliable estimate can be made. These are reviewed 
at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates. 
 
A disclosure for a contingent liability is made where there is a possible obligation arising out of past event, the existence of which 
will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control 
of the Company or a present obligation arising out of past event where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be 
required to settle or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made.
 
Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized when the expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract are 
lower 

than the unavoidable costs of meeting the future obligations under the contract.
 
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, 

the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as 
a finance cost.
1.18
 
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
 
Cash and Cash equivalents include cash and Cheque in hand, bank balances, demand deposits with banks and other short-term 
highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash & which are subject to an insignificant risk 
of changes 
in value where original maturity is three months or less.
1.19
 
CASH FLOW STATEMENT
 
Cash flows are reported using the indirect method where by the profit before tax is adjusted for the effect of the transactions of a 
non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past and future operating cash receipts or payments and items of income or expenses 
associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the company 
are segregated.
1.20
 
BORROWING COST
 
General and specific borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets 

are capitalized as a part of Cost of that assets, during the period till all the activities necessary to prepare the Qualifying assets for its 
intended use or sale are complete during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the assets for its intended use 
or sale. Qualifying assets are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale.
 
Other borrowing costs are recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
1.21
 
EARNINGS PER SHARE
 
Basic EPS is arrived at based on net profit after tax available to equity shareholders to the weighted average number of equity shares 

outstanding during the year. The diluted EPS is calculated on the same basis as basic EPS, after adjusting for the effects of potential 
dilutive equity shares unless impact is anti-dilutive.
1.22
 
SEGMENT REPORTING
 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to Chief Operating Decision Maker (
CODM).
 
The Company has identified its Managing Director as CODM who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance 
of the operating segments and makes strategic decisions.
1.23
 
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
 
When an item of income or expense within profit or loss from ordinary activity is of such size, nature or incidence that their 
disclosure is 

relevant to explain the performance of the Company for the year, the nature and amount of such items is disclosed as exceptional items.
1.24
 
CASH DIVIDEND
 
The Company recognizes a liability to pay dividend when the distribution is authorised and the distribution is no longer at the 

discretion of the Company i.e. when the dividend distribution is being approved by the shareholders. A corresponding amount is 
recognized directly in equity.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 
The Management assessed that cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables and other current liabilities approximate 

their carrying amounts largely due to the short term maturities of these instruments. The fair value of the financial assets and financial 
liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, 
other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
 
 
The Company uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation 

technique:
        
 
Level 1:
 Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
 
Level 2: 
Other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly 
or indirectly.
 
Level 3:
 Techniques which use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.

Fair value estimation
 
For financial instruments measured at fair value in the Balance Sheet, a three level fair value hierarchy is used that reflects the 
significance of inputs used in the measurements. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurem
ents).
 
The categories used are as follows:
       






Level 1

The fair value of investments in equity is based on the price quotation at the reporting date derived from quoted market prices 
in active market. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial 

institutions. Foreign exchange forward contracts are valued using valuation techniques, which employs the use of market 
observable inputs. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing using present value calculations.

RISK MANAGEMENT
 
Financial risk management objectives and policies
 
The Company™s financial risk management is an integral part of how to plan and execute its business strategies. The Company™s 
activity expose it to market risk, liquidity risk, commodity risk and credit risk. In order to minimise any adverse effects on the financial 
performance of the Company, derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency and 
interest rate swaps are entered to hedge certain foreign currency risk exposures to hedge variable interest rate exposures. 
Derivatives

are used exclusively for hedging purposes and not as trading or speculative instruments. The Company™s financial risk management 
policy is set by the Managing Director and governed by overall direction of Board of Directors of the Company.
 
Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash flows that may result from a change in the 
price of a financial 

instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency exchange 
rates, equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk 
sensitive financial instruments including investments and deposits, foreign currency receivables, payables and loans and borrowings.

CREDIT RISK
 
Credit risk arises from the possibility that the counter party may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To manage this, 

the Company periodically assess financial reliability of customers, taking into account the financial condition, current 
economic 
trends, and analysis of historical bad debts and ageing of accounts receivable. Individual risk limits are set accordingly.
 
 
The Company considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of asset and whether there has been a significant 

increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis through each reporting period. To assess whether there is a significant increase in 
credit risk the Company compares the risk of default occurring on asset as at the reporting date with the risk of default as at the 

date of initial recognition. It considers reasonable and supportive forwarding-looking information such as:
i) 
 
Actual or expected significant adverse changes in business
ii) 
 
Actual or expected significant changes in the operating results of the counterparty
 
iii) 
 
Financial or economic conditions that are expected to cause a significant change to the counterparty™s ability to meet its 
obligations
iv) 
 
Significant increase in credit risk on other financial instruments of the same counterparty
 
The company catogarises financial assets based on the assumptions, inputs and factors specific to the class of financial assets 
into High-quality assets, negligible credit risk; Quality assets, low credit risk; Standard assets, moderate credit risk; Substandard 
assets, relatively high credit risk; Low quality assets, very high credit risk; Doubtful assets, credit-impaired.
 
Financial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectations of recovery, such as a debtor failing to engage in a 
repayment plan with the Company. The Company categorises a loan or receivable for write off when a debtor fails to make 
contractual payments greater than one year past due. Where loans or receivables have been written off, the Company continues 
engage in enforcement activity to attempt to recover the receivable due. Where recoveries are made, these are recognized in 

profit or loss.

MARKET RISK - INTEREST RATE RISK
 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of the financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes

IMPACT OF COVID-19 
 
In March 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic which continues to spread across the country. On 
25th March, 2020, the Government of India has declared this pandemic a health emergency, ordered temporarily closure of all 
non-essential businesses, imposed restrictions on movement of goods/material, travel, etc. As the nature of business performed 
by the Company majorly fell under non-essential category, these restrictions had substantially reduced its operations at various 

plants for 25 to 35 days. The Company has since, after receiving applicable permissions, partially commenced operations 
including despatch of goods to its™ customers at all of its manufacturing facilities and scaling up the same gradually.
  
 
In assessing the recoverability of trade receivables measured at amortised cost of 
r
 31260 lakhs and realisation of inventories of 
 
r
 89057 lakhs, apart from considering the internal and external information up to the date of approval of these standalone financial 
statements, the Company has also
 
 performed sensitivity analysis on the assumptions used and based on current indicators of 
future economic conditions, the Company expects to recover the carrying amount of these assets. Refer Note 1 of the Financial 
statements for accounting policy followed by the company for subsequent measurement of these assets.
 
The impact of the global health pandemic may be different from that estimated as at the date of approval of these standalone 
financial statements. Considering the continuing uncertainties, the Company will continue to closely monitor any material 

changes to future economic conditions.

The sensitivity analyses above have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions 
occurring at the end of the reporting year and may not be representative of the actual change. It is based on a change in 
the key assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. When calculating the sensitivity to the assumption, the 

same method used to calculate the liability recognised in the balance sheet has been applied. The methods and types of 
assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared with the previous year.

LEASES
 
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (ﬁMCAﬂ) through Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2019 and Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standards) Second Amendment Rules, has notified Ind AS 116 Leases which replaces the existing lease standard, 
Ind AS 17 Leases and other interpretations. Ind AS 116 sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and 
disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors. It introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees.
 
Effective April 1, 2019, the Company has adopted Ind AS 116 ﬁLeasesﬂ using modified retrospective approach. The Company™s 
lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for buildings and vehicles. These leases were classified as ﬁOperating Leasesﬂ under 
Ind AS 17. On transition to Ind AS 116 ﬁLeasesﬂ, for these leases, lease liabilities were measured at the present value of remaining 

lease payments, discounted at the Company™s incremental borrowing rate as at April 01, 2019. Right to Use if measured either at 
an amount equal to the lease liability adjusted by the amount of any prepaid  or accrued lease payments.
 
Due to transition, the nature of expenses in respect of operating leases has changed from ﬁlease rentﬂ to ﬁdepreciation costﬂ and 
‚™finance cost™™ for the right-to-use assets and for interest accrued on lease liability respectively, and therefore, these expenses for the 

current year are not comparable to the previous years, to that extent.
 
The Company has used following practical expedient, when applying Ind AS 116 to leases previously classified as operating leases 

under Ind AS 17.


the date of initial transition and low value assets



 
The weighted average lessee™s incremental borrowing rate applied to the lease liabilities is 9%.
 
On transition to the Ind ASŒ116, Impact thereof is as follows:

The difference between the lease obligation under Ind AS 17 disclosed under Note no. 37 of the annual standalone financial statements 
for the year ended March 31, 2019 and the value of the lease liability as of April 1, 2019 is primarily on account of inclusion of 
extension and termination options reasonably certain to be exercised in measuring the lease liability in accordance with Ind AS 116 
and discounting the lease liabilities to the present value under Ind AS 116.

Notes:
a)
 
Most of the issues of litigation pertaining to Central Excise/Service Tax/Income Tax are based on interpretation of the respective 
Law & Rules thereunder. Management has been opined by its counsel that many of the issues raised by revenue will not be 
sustainable in law as they are covered by judgments of respective judicial authorities which supports its contention. As such 
no 
material impact on the financials of the Company is envisaged. 
b) 
 
Sales Tax and Entry Tax related litigation/demand primarily pertains to non-receipt of declaration forms from customers and 

mismatch of input tax credit or some interpretation related issues w.r.t. applicability of schemes. Counsel of the Company opined 

positive outcome based on merits of the cases under litigation. In most of the cases, required documents are being filed and 
minor impact if any, shall be given in the year of final outcome of respective matter in appeal.
c) 
 
Other issues are either in ordinary course of business or not of substantial nature and management is reasonably confident of 
their positive outcome. Management shall deal with them judiciously and provide for appropriately, if any such need arises.
d) 
 
There is uncertainty and ambiguity in interpreting and giving effect to the guidelines of Hon. Supreme Court vide its ruling 

in February 2019, in relation to the scope of compensation on which the organisation and its employees are to contribute 
towards Provident Fund. In the assessment of the management, the aforesaid matter is not likely to have a significant impact 
and accordingly, no provision has been made in the financial statements.

Independent Auditors™ Report on Consolidated Financial Statements
To the Members of

Report on the Audit of Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of The Supreme Industries Limited (ﬁthe Parent Companyﬂ), its

31, 2020, the consolidated statement of Profit & Loss (including other comprehensive income), the consolidated Statement of changes in 
equity and the consolidated Statement of cash flow for the year than ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary 
of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are included the financial statements for the year ended on 

that date audited by the branch auditors of the parent company™s 24 manufacturing units located in the India.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid consolidated  financial 
statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the Act)  in the manner so required and give a true and fair view 
in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group  as at 31st March 
2020, the consolidated profits (including other comprehensive income), consolidated changes in equity and its consolidated cash flows 

for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under 

section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor™s Responsibilities for the Audit 

of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of 

Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit 
of the consolidated financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. 
We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred 
to in Other Matter paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated financial 

statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial 

statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a 

whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Key Audit Matters
Auditor™s response
1.
Inventory Œ existence and valuation
As at March 31, 2020, the Group held inventories of 
r
 89,057 Lakhs. [Refer Note no. 1.9 and  11 to the 
Consolidated Financial statements]
Inventories existence and valuation was an audit focus 
area because of nationwide lockdown imposed by the 

Government of India in view of   pandemic coronavirus  
(COVID 19). 
As explained by the Management, due to COVID 19 related 
restriction on account of nationwide lockdown, physical 

verification of inventories, lying at various locations as on 
the Balance sheet date and subsequently also till the date 
of this report, couldn™t  be carried out.
We have accordingly designated this as a focus area of the 
audit.
Audit Procedure performed:
We have performed following alternative audit procedures over 
inventory existence and valuations.
(a)
 
Ensuring the effectiveness of the design, implementation  and 
maintenance of controls over changes in inventory to determine 

whether the conduct of physical inventory verification at a date  

other than the date of the financial statement is appropriate 
and testing of those controls whether those have operated 
effectively.
(b)
 
Performing procedures to ensure that the changes in inventory 

between the last verification date and date of the Balance sheet 
are properly recorded (Roll forward procedures)
(c)
 
Performing substantive analytical procedures to test the 
correctness of inventory existence and valuation
(d)
 
Testing of accuracy of inventory reconciliations with the general 
ledgers at period end, including test of reconciling items
The procedures performed gave us a sufficient evidence to conclude 
about the inventory existence and valuation.

Key Audit Matters
Auditor™s response
2.
Industrial Promotion Scheme (IPS) receivables
Other current assets include government grant in the form of 
refund of Sales tax/GST under IPS Scheme of 
r
 7,929 lakhs 
as at March 31, 2020 (
r
 6,242 lakhs as at March 31, 2019) 
from the states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, West 

Bengal and Rajasthan as the respective scheme notifications 

were issued by the aforesaid State Governments.
Post GST, the state of west Bengal is yet to notify the IPS 
scheme and accordingly, the Company has not recognized 

grant, since July 2017 the amount whereof is presently not 
ascertainable. 
Management judgement is involved in assessing the 
accounting for grants and particularly in considering 

the probability of a grant being released and we have 

accordingly designated this as a focus area of the audit.
Audit Procedure performed:
In response to the risk of completeness of the accruals in the 
standalone financial statements:
We have examined the eligibility certificates and obtained a list of 
year wise break- up of the IPS receivables by the Company for all 
the financial years. 
We had discussed the status of the assessment of grants receivable 
for all the financial years and the Management view on the expected 
time frame by which the grants will be released. 
Additionally, we have considered the status of the previous 
assessments and the adjustments, if any, done by the respective 

concerned authorities.
The procedures performed gave us a sufficient evidence to conclude 
that the grants have been accounted in terms of the schemes 

announced by various state governments.

The respective Board of Directors of the Companies included in the Group are also responsible for overseeing the financial 
reporting 
process of the Group.
  
109
Auditor™s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
  
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor™s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 

level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when 
it exists. 
  
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
  
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 
We also:
  


and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as 

fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

adequate internal financial control system in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.

obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the entity™s ability 

to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor™s 
report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor™s report. However, future events or conditions 

may cause the entity to cease to continue as a going concern.

















the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of 
the audit of the financial statements of such entities included in the consolidated financial statements of which we are independent 
auditors. For the other entities included in the consolidated financial statements, which have been audited by other auditors, such 

other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely 

responsible for our audit opinion.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the consolidated financial statements that individually or in aggregate makes it probable 
that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the consolidated financial statements may be influenced. We consider 
quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope pf our audit work and in evaluating the results of 
our work and (ii) 

to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the consolidated financial statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company of which we are the independent auditors regarding, 
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in 
internal control that we identify during our audit. 
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 

independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in 
our auditor™s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we 
determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be 

expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

BASIS OF PREPRATION AND MEASUREMENT
 
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (hereinafter referred 
to as the ‚Ind AS™) as notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting standards) Rules, 2015 and Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Amendments Rules 2016  prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013. 
 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group are prepared and presented on accrual basis and under the historical cost 
convention, except for the following material items that have been measured at fair value as required by the relevant Ind AS:







 
These consolidated financial statements are approved for issue by the Company™s Board of Directors on May 22, 2020.
1.3
 
USE OF ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
 
The preparation of the financial statements requires that the Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities as at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts 
of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The recognition, measurement, classification or disclosure of an item or 
information in the financial statements is made relying on these estimates.
 
The estimates and judgements used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are continuously evaluated by the 
Group and are based on historical experience and various other assumptions and factors (including expectations of future events) that 
the Group believes to be reasonable under the existing circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Any revision 

to accounting estimates is recognised prospectively in current and future periods.
 
All the assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-current as per the group™s normal operating cycle of twelve months 

and other criteria set out in Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013.
 
Areas involving critical estimates and Judgements are:




1.4
 
BASIS OF PREPRATION OF CONSOLIDATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries and associates as at 31 
March 2020. The Parent Company prepares and report its consolidated financial statements in INR (
r
).
 
Subsidiaries:
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31
st
 March, 2020
 
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the group has control. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to 
variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. 
Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has:





 
The group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more 
of the three elements of controls. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases 
when the group losses control of the subsidiary.
 
Consolidation procedure:
 
Subsidiaries:
a)
 
Combine, on line by line basis like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of the parent with those 

of its subsidiaries. For this purpose, income and expenses of the subsidiary are based on the amounts of the assets and liabilities 
recognised in the consolidated financial statements at the acquisition date.
b)
 
Offset (eliminate) the carrying amount of the parent™s investment in each subsidiary and the parent™s portion of equity of 
each 
subsidiary. Business combinations policy explains how to account for any related goodwill.
c)
 
Eliminate in full intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between entities 

of the group (profits or losses resulting from intragroup transactions that are recognised in assets, such as inventory and fixed 
assets, are eliminated in full). Intragroup losses may indicate an impairment that requires recognition in the consolidated fin
ancial 
statements. Ind AS12 Income Taxes applies to temporary differences that arise from the elimination of profits and losses resulting 

from intragroup transactions.
 
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-

controlling interests. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling 

interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
 
Consolidated financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar 

circumstances. If a member of the group uses accounting policies other than those adopted in the consolidated financial statements for 

like transactions and events in similar circumstances, appropriate adjustments are made to that group member™s financial statements 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements to ensure conformity with the group™s accounting policies.
 
The financial statements of all entities used for the purpose of consolidation are drawn up to same reporting date as that of the parent 
company, i.e., year ended on 31 March. When the end of the reporting period of the parent is different from that of a subsidiary, 

the subsidiary prepares, for consolidation purposes, additional financial information as of the same date as the financial statements 
of the parent to enable the parent to consolidate the financial information of the subsidiary, unless it is impracticable to do so.
1.5
 
GOODWILL
 
Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is initially recognized at cost at the date of acquisition. After initial recognition, 
goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any.
1.6
 
INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES
 
Associates are all entities over which the group has significant influences but not control or joint control. This is generally the case 

where the group holds between 20% to 50% of the voting rights or the group has power to participate in the financial and operating 
policy decision of the investee. Investments in associate are accounted for using equity method accounting.
 
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method 
of accounting, except when the investment, or a portion thereof, is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in 
accordance with Ind AS 105.
 
Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognised in the consolidated balance sheet at cost and adjusted 
thereafter to recognise the Group™s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate. 
 
On acquisition of the investment in an associate, any excess of the cost of the investment over the Group™s share of the net fair 

value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee is recognised as goodwill, which is included within the 
carrying amount 

of the investment. Any excess of the Group™s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities over the cost of the 
investment, after reassessment, is recognised directly in equity as capital reserve in the period in which the investment is acquired.
 
Distributions received from an associate reduce the carrying amount of the investment.  Unrealised gains on transactions between 
the group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the group™s interest in these entities. Unrealised losses 

are also eliminated unless the transactions provides evidence of an impairment of the assets transferred.
118
 
When the Group™s share of losses of an associate exceeds the Group™s interest in that associate (which includes any long-term interests 
that, in substance, form part of the Group™s net investment in the associate), the Group discontinues recognising its share of further 
losses. Additional losses are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made 
payments on behalf of the associate.
 
Change in Ownership Interest:
 
When the Group ceases to consolidate or equity account for an investment because of a loss of control or significant influence, any 

retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value with the change in carrying amount recognized in profit or loss. This fair 

value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequent accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint 
venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity 
are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts 
previously 

recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss. 
 
If the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts 

previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.
1.7
 
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS
 
In preparing the financial statements of each individual group entity, transactions in currencies other than the entity™s functional 

currency (foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each 
reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary 
items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair 

value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
 
Exchange differences on monetary items are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise except for:

nor likely to occur (therefore forming part of the net investment in the foreign operation), which are recognised initially in other 
comprehensive income and reclassified from equity to profit or loss on repayment of the monetary items. 
 
For the purposes of presenting these consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group™s foreign operations are 
translated into Indian Rupees using exchange rates prevailing at the end of each reporting period. Income and expense items are 
translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case 
the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive 

income and accumulated in equity (and attributed to non-controlling interests as appropriate).
 
On disposal of  foreign operations (i.e. a disposal of the Group™s entire interest in a foreign operation, a disposal involving loss of 

control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, or a partial disposal of an interest in a joint arrangement or an associate 
that includes a foreign operation of which the retained interest becomes a financial asset), all of the exchange differences accumulated 
in equity in respect of that operation attributable to the owners of the Group are reclassified to profit or loss.
 
In addition, in relation to a partial disposal of a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation that does not result in the Group losing 

control over the subsidiary, the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences are re-attributed to non-controlling interests 

and are not recognised in profit or loss. For all other partial disposals (i.e. partial disposals of associates or joint arrangements that do 
not result in the Group losing significant influence or joint control), the proportionate share of the accumulated exchange differences 
is reclassified to profit or loss.
1.8
 
SEGMENT REPORTING
 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to Chief Operating Decision Maker (
CODM).
 
The Group has identified its Managing Director as CODM which assesses the operational performance and position of the Group 

and makes strategic decisions.

Notes:
a)
 
Most of the issues of litigation pertaining to Central Excise/Service Tax/Income Tax are based on interpretation of the respective 
Law & Rules thereunder. Management has been opined by its counsel that many of the issues raised by revenue will not be 
sustainable in law as they are covered by judgments of respective judicial authorities which supports its contention.  As such no 
material impact on the financials of the Group is envisaged.
  
b) 
 
Sales Tax and Entry Tax related  litigation/demand primarily pertains to non- receipt of declaration forms from customers and 
mismatch of input tax credit or some interpretation related issues w.r.t. applicablity of schemes. Counsel of the Company opined 
positive outcome based on merits of the cases under litigation. In most of the cases, required documents are being filed and 

minor impact if any, shall be given in the year of final outcome of respective matter in appeal.
   
c) 
 
Other issues are either in ordinary course of business or  not of substantial nature and management is reasonably confident of 

their positive outcome. Management shall deal with them judiciously and provide for appropriately, if any such need arises.
 
d) 
 
There is uncertainty and ambiguity in interpreting and giving effect to the guidelines of Hon. Supreme Court vide its ruling 
in 

February 2019, in relation to the scope of compensation on which the organisation and its employees are to contribute towards 
Provident Fund. In In the assessment of the management, the aforesaid matter is not likely to have a significant impact and 
accordingly, no provision has been made in the financial statements.
