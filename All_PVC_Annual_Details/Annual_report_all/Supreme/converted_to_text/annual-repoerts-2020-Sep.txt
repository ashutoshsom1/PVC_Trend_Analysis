Management Discussion and Analysis
1.
 
OVERVIEW
 
The year under review was the toughest in the history of the 
Company. It started with an extreme negative outlook. The 
Company had to keep operations of its 24 plants™ closed for 
most part of the month of April 2020 and could begin in a 

gradual manner from last week of April onwards complying 
the prescribed guidelines. 
 
In the last 10 days, just before the closing of the year, the 

business has again witnessed tough situation as Covid Œ 19 
second wave started affecting the general public with alarming 

speed. The situation has become further volatile due to steep 
increase in Polymer prices. The increase in prices of PVC was 
steepest. In the last 40 years, international prices of PVC have 

never reached to the levels seen in April 2021 especially in 
India, some other Latin American countries and Turkey.
 
The Company however has come out of these two extreme 

adverse situations with unparalleled performance where the 
profit of the Company was highest in its 79 years of operations. 

This was partly supported by more than 
R
 200 crores inventory 
gain on account of raw material price increase which accrued 

in its operations for the year.
 
The Company™s focus remained to penetrate maximum Tehsils 

with larger base of retailers to have its goods 
reach to the 
customers with ease and in a most economical
 manner.
 
The business in most of the segments of the Company starting 

from June 2020 remained positive, barring in the month of July 
2020, where regional lock down in some parts of the Country 
affected smooth operations.
 
In spite of Covid-19 second wave, the Company is optimistic 
about further growth prospects. The country™s war against 
Covid-19 was strengthened with successful developments 

of vaccines by two local producers and more producers / 
suppliers may offer from India and abroad to implement 
massive vaccination programme undertaken by the country.
 
Even with temporary setback which the Company is 
experiencing in the month of April 2021, the Company has 
not reduced its Capex plan for the year 2021-22. In the current 

year, not only there will be brownfield expansion of capacities 
and new products at the existing plants but Company has also 
embarked on putting up three new greenfield plants in the 

states of Assam, Orissa and Tamilnadu during the current year.

locations in near future alongside the new upcoming units. 
 
With the help of specialists the Company has embarked upon 
a new activity with nomenclature as ﬁPlumbing Workshopﬂ 

which is a full day session with Plumbers. Here the sharing is 
of latest Plumbing techniques along with applications of new 
products introduced by the Company in the recent past in 

the range. The markets have well appreciated it and there is 
pressure on Company to increase the Plumbing Workshop 
numbers substantially. The Company could organize only 61 

Plumbing workshops in the year 2020-21 owing to corona 
pandemic. Company plans to continue organizing the 
Plumbing Workshops based on situation during the year 2021-

22. There are now more than 90,000 Plumbers connected 
with the Company.
 
Company has started monitoring data of retailers who buy 
regularly through its distribution channels. An action plan to 

increase the number of such retailers on all India basis has 
been worked out and is being tracked. There are now more 
than 35,900 retailers connected with Piping System Business 

on regular basis.
 
FlameGuard CPVC pipe system made by the Company is 

considered as a very safe material for the use in fire sprinkler 
system in many parts of the country. 
 
Unlike plumbing system, a fire sprinkler system requires 
multiple approvals. In last financial year Karnataka issued 
approval order for the use of CPVC system in fire sprinkler 
system. This will help to promote the system in Karnataka 

market. The approvals are also obtained from Pune and Kalyan-
Dombivali Municipal Corporations. In Gujarat the use of the 
system has started in Ahmedabad, Rajkot and Mehsana towns.
 
Higher cost of the system is still a major concern. To bring down 
the cost company has started manufacturing the compound 
locally and supply of locally made fittings in India.
33
 
The cost of the GI pipes for fire sprinkler has shown steep 
increase and the price gap between metal and CPVC system 
has reduced considerably. The system has limited success in a 
part of the country where MS pipe is still considered as material 

for installation in sprinkler system instead of GI pipe. The cost 
of the MS pipe is approximately 20-25% less compared to GI 
pipe system. 
 
The revision of the Indian standards for this system is in stage 
of finalisation and are expected to be published in this FY 
21-22. Real boost for the CPVC sprinkler system business is 

expected only after all standards are in place.
 
Product installation training for this system is a mandatory 

requirement before the actual installation starts to avoid 
hiccups. The Company provides the technical support by 
providing the Bill of Quantities (BOQ) from the sprinkler 

layout of the project. The Company also offers full support to 
the installer including the value engineering to reduce the cost 
without compromising the quality of the installation.
 
To support environment concern, Company is gearing up 

to meet with National Green Tribunal directive of phasing 
out Lead stabilizers from manufacturing of different types of 
uPVC Pipes. The Company has already started using lead free 

stabilisers in certain piping system. In other system a schedule 
has been drawn to phase out lead stabilisers.

 FURNITURE
 
The Company™s furniture business declined by 5% in value 
terms over last year and 10% in volume terms due to lockdown 
which had a severe impact on the furniture business for 1st 
Quarter. The sales of 1st Quarter declined by a steep 70% over 

last year same period. However, the business started picking 
up from 2
nd
 quarter and showed growth only from 3rd quarter 
onwards. 
 
Furniture demand was adversely affected due to pandemic 
restrictions as a large part of furniture sales come from Schools, 

Colleges, Hotels, Restaurants, Decorators, Marriage Places 
etc and this segment had a severe impact on their business 
due to the pandemic. Even the Govt buying for furniture was 

restricted as the focus was on healthcare and most of the funds 
were diverted for the same. Some of the key markets remained 
partially closed during the 2
nd
 & 3
rd
 quarter with restricted 
activities. However, the Company could achieve similar sales 
in 2
nd
 quarter as last year same period and had good growth 
in 3
rd
 & 4
th
 quarter indicating signs of growth for 2021-22. 
 
The Company manufactures furniture made with all three 
different processes i.e Injection Moulding, Blow Moulding 
& Roto Moulding. The company has been manufacturing 
Injection Moulded furniture for 30 years and is a market leader 

in terms of it™s wide range & quality. Currently, the company 
manufactures injection moulded furniture at 6 locations 
viz Pondicherry (UT), Durgapur ( West Bengal), Guwahati 

(Assam), Gadegaon (Maharashtra), Lalru (Punjab) & Jadcherla 
(Telangana) to cater to customers effectively in different parts 
of the country. The Company™s Jadcherla plant is now well 

established and will be able to cater to adjoining markets cost 
efficiently. 
 
During the year, the Company™s sale of Blow Moulded table 
range grew by 24% over last year driven by good demand 
of compact folding tables for ‚Work From Home™ and sales 
through E-commerce. The company™s range of Blow Moulded 

tables is now well established and poised for good growth. The 
company™s plan for adding 2 new models in this segment was 
delayed due to pandemic and are likely to be introduced in 

first half of 2021-22. 
 
The Company had started manufacture of Roto Moulded 
Furniture in Feb 2020 and thereafter due to lockdown this 
segment could not be properly marketed as Kindergarten 

Schools which is one of the largest customers of the product 
launched were closed all through the year due to the 
pandemic. The Company plans to launch variety of models 

in Roto Moulded Furniture catering to different segments and 
is in the process of identifying suitable furniture which can be 
made through Roto Moulding. 
 
The Company introduced 5 new models during the year and 
all the models introduced were unique and cater to premium 
segment. Out of the 5 new models, 4 models were introduced 

with Gas Injection moulding technology using glass reinforced 
polymers. All these models are unique in their design, shape 
and usage. All the new models have been very well received 

and hope to give good growth in the coming year. The 
company plans to launch another 5 new models during the 
first half of 2021-22 which will help in overall growth in the 

coming year. 
 
The Company is committed to make available its furniture 

across India and is aggressively working towards increasing its 
retail penetration. The Company currently has 13,650 retailers 
selling its furniture who are serviced through our network of 

1,251 channel partners. The Company plans to add 1,400 

retail outlets during the year. The Company has identified some 
of its weak markets and has planned to intensify the marketing 
activity in those markets for improving its retail penetration and 

increasing the number of channel partners in these markets. 
 
The Company™s furniture range is sold on various e commerce 
portals through a few dedicated channel partners. It grew by 
100% during the year and the biggest spurt in sales was seen 

post lockdown when the markets were not fully functional and 
most of the people were operating from home. The consumer 
behaviour during the year showed a major shift towards online 

shopping and the company along with its channel partners 
geared up its infrastructure to meet the sudden rising demand. 
The company is focused on increasing its online presence and 

product offerings and sees this as a future growth driver. 
 
The company™s export business grew by 27% over last year in 

spite of very high shipping costs, low availability of containers 
and overall increase in freight costs . The growth was majorly 
attributed to acceptance of our product by a leading retailer 

from USA as well as middle east. The company will continue 
to focus on acquiring more customers and already in dialogue 
with some other leading retailers. However, due to very steep 

increase in sea freights and furniture being a voluminous item, 
the retailers are holding on to their decision for the time being.
 
 
The recent spate of increase in Covid cases across India 

amid restrictions and partial lockdowns have thrown up new 
challenges and the company will plan to overcome these 

challenges to ensure business growth in 21-22. 
4.3 INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS
4.3.1
 INDUSTRIAL COMPONENTS
 
The year 2020-21 started with already imposed country wide 

lockdown for containment of Covid-19 Pandemic. Obviously, 
there was no good news on economic front. The Division 
mainly caters to Appliance and Automotive sectors and both 

these sectors not being Priority or Essential category, were 
not given any relaxation, thereby, these sectors were badly 
affected during first quarter with negligible sales revenue. 

Although, from latter part of May™20, relaxations in lockdown 
were gradually eased in phased manner, it took long time 
to stabilize the Supply Chain of our customers, resulting in 
34
massive 
de-growth of nearly 40%
 in both Value and Volume 
terms, during first half of the financial year.
 
Company decided to use this period to carry out all round 
improvements in the area of Productivity, Quality, Cost 

Reduction and People development. The No Production/Low 
Production period was utilized to educate team members 
on World Class Management Practices, Lean Manufacturing, 

Training on identified Skill Gaps, Soft Skills etc by series of 
Virtual Learning Programs, both by the Internal and External 
Faculties. Team members from both Staff and Associate 

category from various plants of the Division were involved in 
this exercise during this period. This training helped company 
to launch Cost Management Project, code named ﬁRainbow 

Projectﬂ for focused cost reduction. Strategy was made and its 
implementation started to develop new businesses to improve 
Capacity Utilization of certain underutilized Machines and 

Equipment. All these actions started yielding results when 
demand recovery started during second half of the year.
 
Recovery started during 3rd Quarter and got further 

accelerated in 4th Quarter. The recoveries in various sectors 
of Appliances like Washing Machines, Air Conditioners, 

Coolers and Refrigerators, segments where company has 

good presence, boosted the revenue during second half of the 
year. Demand recovery in Auto sector also helped Division 
for revenue growth with significant demand up stick in all the 

Segments of company™s presence like Passenger Vehicles, Two 
Wheelers and Commercial Vehicles. This resulted in overall 
growth for the year. The Division posted decent 
growth
, both 

in 
Value and Volume
 term at 
over 11% and 6% respectively
 
during FY 20-21 over FY 19-20.
 
Until second half of March™21, the Outlook for FY 21-22 was 

looking bright with the momentum which had already picked 
up in Q4 of FY 20-21. Things have become uncertain within 
a month with huge surge in Covid caseload in the country 

necessitating to put across stringent curbs by various state 
Govts. As it stands in short term, the situation is not very clear 
on Business outlook. However, company feels that Business 

scenario remains bullish in medium and long term with 
business friendly policies by the Govt. Company has planned 
need based Capacity Augmentation to handle the projected 

increased demand going forward. The new machines being 
planned are with the latest Technology, Energy efficient, 
and Robust Design for Excellent Quality and Repeatability. 

Company is also working on cost efficient Automation.
 
Overall rating of the company by its Customers meets or 

exceeds their expectations and the company is considered as 

one the most reliable suppliers in its area of expertise by the 
customers. This has helped the Division to get extra business 
from its customers whenever other suppliers failed to supply. 

Division is continuously striving to excel in all Operational 
Parameters as its culture. It helps company to remain cost 
efficient in this fiercely competitive supply chain to OEM 

Customers.
4.3.2
 Material Handling Products 
 
The financial year began amid chaos, confusion and 

uncertainty. 
 
The most contributing sectors to this Material Handling 

Division were not operational due to lock down. The division 

took an aggressive approach and started focusing on sectors 
which were open under essential commodities, retail, FMCG 
etc. The efforts made in the initial periods of lock down paid 

off immensely as a result, the Division has grown by 12% in 
volume and 10% in revenue terms. The most heartening things 
have been the performance in sectors where the division was 

not doing well in the past.
 
Analysing the performance with deeper insights, the Division 
has done exceptionally well in industrial sectors, like 
Automobile, Engineering Consumer durables in later half of 

the year when majority of our users increased their production 
to meet the pent up demand due to lock down. This resulted 
in improved volume of Industrial Crates and Injection Pallets. 

The demand for one time Cargo Pallets was all time high 
due to increased exports by our customers. The Company is 
confident this trend to continue in next year as well.
 
As expressed earlier, the focused efforts in F & V, e-commerce, 

retail and FMCG to counter the negative effects of lockdown 

paid handsomely to your company and the division has 
grown phenomenally in F & V sector by over 38% over last 
year. Company also benefited due to inability of small players 

to keep up their supplies in the market. Company hopes to 
maintain increased share in this segment in the next year. 
 
Company keeps strong focus on Fisheries Jumbo Crates. For 

last few years, Company has been aggressively working to gain 
the market shares in Fisheries Jumbo Crates. This year there 

has been a growth of 20%. Aggressive efforts will continue in 
this sector and for that the Company has started production 
of Jumbo Crates at it™s Jadcherla Unit in this year.
 
The Company™s business to Dairy segment continues to be in 

good shape but without growth. The Company™s crate quality 

is well established and appreciated by it™s customers. The 
Company is confident of a good growth next year. 
 
The Roto moulded Crates and Dustbins have seen decline 
this year. There has been good demand for Injection moulded 
Dustbins by Institutions and Corporates. Encouraged by this, 
Company has decided to introduce many new models of 

Dustbins in the next year. 
 
The Company also plans to introduce new models in Pallets, 
Crates and Ice boxes in Roto Moulding.
 
The Company explored opportunities for export of it™s Crates, 

Pallets, Silpack etc. The Company has achieved reasonable 
success and Company will aggressively pursue to further 

enhance exports in the current Year. 
 
The Company is reputed for its high quality products and 
timely supplies which helps it to retain it™s top customers. With 
increased demand, the Division is augmenting its production 

capacities by expansion at it™s Lalru and Gadegaon Units for 
Crates and at Gadegaon for pallets with new models.
 
The Company has not only retained its regular customers but 
has also been able to increase numbers of customers who are 
patronizing Company™s products regularly.
 
The Company has opened Fabrication facility at Chennai which 
is functional and serving the Automobile and Industrial sector 
customers in vicinity of Chennai timely and efficiently hoping 
to double its turnover next year. 
 
The Company was not able to augment it™s Channel Network 

and widen it™s reach this year but aims to add across India 

more than 10% new partners in existing Channel Network in 
the current year. 
4.3.3
 Composite LPG Cylinder
 
The updated component design and improved plant processes 
following Poka-yoke system have yielded excellent results with 
no customer complaints received since Q3 2019. Repeated 
orders from multiple existing as well as new customers stood 

testimony to the excellent quality of the current product 
offering.
 
The Company continued its current business in Maldives and 

Somalia. New customer footprints have now been established 
in Western & Central Africa, Taiwan and the Caribbean islands. 
35
 
Composite Cylinders fall under direct sales category. New 
customers could not visit India because of restrictions in travel 
due to Covid-19 which hampered our sales volume. 
 
There was no progress in South Korean business as 
representatives of Korean Inspection Agency could not visit 
India. Our customer is setting up Testing Facility in Korea so 
that Korean Inspectors visit to India for quality checks will be 

obviated. Owing to the very high rejections of steel cylinders 
on account of human safety issues, marketing reports have 
forecasted a very bright future for composite LPG cylinders in 

Korea. The Company expects good business in current year 
after restrictions on travel eases.
 
The largest Indian Oil Marketing Company, M/s Indian Oil 

Corporation Limited, purchased small quantity of Composite 
Cylinders in March 2021 for marketing trials in 4 cities of 

India. This augurs well for the long awaited introduction of 
Composite Cylinders in Indian market. 
 
Owing to the various favourable developments, the overall 
prospects for Composite Cylinders in the current year are 

significantly more promising for the Company.

added products to its portfolio. Continuous efforts to develop 
new products will help the division grow better this year
 
Exports have declined. Sales were only 1,343 tons as against 
1,451 tons in the previous year, mostly because of the Covid 

situation all over. Till travel becomes normal, there may not

MANUFACTURING, INNOVATION & TECHNOLOGY
 
Manufacturing 
 
Jadcherla: The plant started its commercial production from 

July™ 2020 onwards. Capacity utilisation has been 50% in the 
9 months till March 2021. The Company expects to touch 
70% utilisation in the current year & over 80% thereafter.
 
Hosur: With the unit now well established, it is working on 
further improving its operational efficiencies. Several new 
products, have been introduced by the unit. This will create 

new export opportunities, besides increasing domestic 
business. This will further improve capacity utilisation in 
the coming year. Fabrication facilities are being adequately 

upgraded to offer cost effective solutions & wider range of 
products to our customers
 
Urse-2 plant (fabrication facility) is certified with SEDEX 4 pillar. 
A prerequisite for some of the export products. The same was 
renewed last year. 
 
Innovation
 
The design of single screw foam extruder of 300 kg/hrs capacity 

in Urse plant has been modified with a unique screw design 
which has resulted in a 14.5% higher production capacity and 

also density reduction comparable with the latest version of 
Tandem Extruder which are installed at other units. 
 
Through re-engineering by R&D team, the productivity of all 

foam extruders and lamination plants has been increased over 
the original equipment design capacity. The overall product 

density has been reduced by 0.5 kg/m3 without deteriorating 
the quality standards, which has resulted to material savings. 
All the units are working further for the reduction of density. 
 
Through technological up-gradation, the existing crosslink 

extruded foam for Insulation application has been modified 

with reduced density matching the specified values as per BS 
476 for Class 1 and Class 0.
36
 
By incorporating some design changes in the equipment of 
NBR plant of Malanpur, the unit has achieved 20% higher 
production in sheets, enabling it to be more competitive in 
the market. The unit is also working on improving output of 

tubes in a similar manner. 
 
TPE Yoga mats have been developed as an import substitute 

and has been well received in the market. These products 

would also create additional export opportunities. 
 
Technology
 
The Company has been granted a patent (Patent no. 347416, 

A Manufacturing process for block foam) for its innovative 
method of recycling the non-recyclable crosslink waste which, 
in-general, cannot be converted with conventional methods. 

This has enabled us to use our own cross linked wastage in 
larger quantities.
 
As a result, Crosslink block foam variants have been developed 
with 65% recycle material (cross linked waste). 
 
This product is well accepted for some heavy duty packaging 

applications. Now R&D team is working on developing several 

new products by using high volume of recycled material. These 
are expected to be launched this year. The Company hopes 
to achieve almost zero sale of it™s cross linked scrap in time to 

come.
 
The Hot-melt Glue Adhesive coating machine has been 
modified from its original design for the use of the multipurpose 
usage as required which has enhanced our ability to make 

multiple products with significant cost savings.
 
The technical team reengineered the 2 stage block foam line 

resulting in increased productivity of 17% & wastage reduction 

by 5%
 
New Initiatives
 
New variant of interlock mat for various sports applications has 

been developed at Hosur by using recycled material which has 

facilitated to counter Chinese imports. The Company expects 
good business in the coming year
 
The division is working hard to use alternate energy sources 
like the solar & wind. Significant savings of the power cost have 
been achieved at Hosur unit and the process will be replicated 
at other units also during the current year. 
 
While the new year has begun with Covid-19 raring its 

serpentine head again, The Company believes that, with all 
measures taken by the Company, this year would be a good 
one for the division.
4.4.3
 CROSS LAMINATED FILM
 
The Business of Cross Laminated Film & Products recorded 

an impressive growth of 28.50% in volume terms despite 
challenging conditions posed by COVID-19 pandemic. The 
company lost sales of almost whole of April, 2020 due to 

lockdown but came back strongly to post remarkable growth 
in sales at the backdrop of robust demand for its products. The 
growth in demand was due to intensive market penetration 

by adding new channel partners and retailers, timely supplies, 
and introduction of additional varieties in made up products 
and boost in export volume.
 
The healthy order book at year end suggests the growth 
in demand will continue. To cater to the growing demand 
prospect, the Company has taken steps to expand the capacity 

from 27,000 MT to 30,000 MT per annum. The Company 
has already received some equipment and the balance will 
come during the current year. Increased capacity will be fully 

operational by January 2022.
 
As per weather forecast by SKYMET the monsoon in India is 

predicted to be normal with no La Nina scare. This will boost 

the demand for company™s products in the coming year.
 
The sale of made up products has grown during the year. 

The Company expects the demand for made up products 

to grow and so has put up a new fabrication facility at Halol 
exclusively for production of these products. The Company 
has soft launched Bio-floc fish tanks in eleven States. There 

were some technical issues in those tanks. They are now being 
addressed. The Company will relaunch this product only after 
addressing those technical issues which must add value to it™s 

customers.
 
The Company™s economy model of tarpaulin under the brand 

name ﬁSupreme Sathiﬂ is well established in the low cost 
Tarpaulin segment. The same is available from it™s generated 
reprocess granules.
 
The division™s exports posted a strong growth of 35% up from 

1183 MT to 1600 MT in the year. The thrust in coming year 

in exports will be mainly on developing newer applications, 
entering new markets and targeting chain stores and super 
markets for sale through their online portals. The Company 

expects the exports to grow further in the coming year. 
 
The intermittent lock down in the European countries 

completely derailed the preparation of drawings of various 
equipment required to put up the Cross Plastic Film project. 
The project will be taken in hand only after detailed drawings 

are ready. The implementation of that project is thus delayed.

In March 2020, Company had taken a conscious decision 

to avail short term borrowings to the tune of 
R
 270 crores 
by way of Working Capital Demand Loans (WCDL), with a 

view to meet all its committed obligations in normal course 

in timely manner & with a view to create war chest to meet 
any eventuality in the situation arising out of lock down due to 
Covid-19 in the whole country. However with the improved 

business situation and cash flows, the company prepaid most 
of its loans by mid June 2020. All other loans were fully paid 
off as per schedule by December, 2020.
2.
 
Working Capital Borrowing
 
During the year, Company dismantled its Consortium 
Arrangement and moved into Multiple Banking Arrangement 
37
(MBA), with a view to achieve better efficiencies at optimum 
cost.
 
Company is thankful to its bankers for their unstinted support 

and also for having agreed to join the MBA on fully unsecured 

basis. As such Company™s working capital facilities aggregating 
to 
R
 1470.90 crores are totally unsecured either by way of 
Primary Security or by way of Collateral Security. This shows 
the confidence reposed by all the Bankers on the company 
and its management, supported by established track record of 
the company, improved operating margin, strong key financial 

ratios year after year. Company had already become debt free 
for its term debt in the preceding year. Now, during the year, it 
stopped borrowing for its working capital requirements as well, 

resulting in a paradigm shift from borrowing to investing its 
accumulated surplus cash into a) highest security mutual funds 
with sound parentage, high AUM (assets under management) 

and b) fixed deposits of highly rated and well established 
companies.
 
Company intends to use its surplus cash to continue to grow 

organically, while being open to explore the opportunities to 
grow inorganically through rightful acquisitions.
 
The Raw Material Prices have seen sharp upward trend during 

the year from May, 2020 onwards. In view of the healthy 
cash flow, Company could utilise its cash accruals to meet 
the increased working capital requirements as well as also 

plan its material procurement appropriately, which resulted 
in uninterrupted production and supplies to its customers. 
 
Company continued to exercise strict control over its 
receivables and also by keeping moderation in inventory levels. 
Through better supplier credit management, it is monitoring 
its working capital cycle effectively & efficiently. 
3. 
 
Dealers™ Financing 
 
The Dealers™ Finance facilities provided to Channel Partners are 
proceeding well. Every year, more & more channel partners are 
joining the Channel Finance Scheme, in view of competitive 

rate of interest & unsecured facilities offered by the bank. 
Seasonal / peak business requirements are also taken care 
of by the Bank, by providing temporary incremental limits. 

Extended credit terms have also been provided to the Channel 
Partners in challenging time during lockdown due to Covid-19 
pandemic last year.

CRISIL Rating
 
As per the latest review conducted in the last quarter, (a) 

the Rating for Company™s Short term bank facilities were 

reaffirmed at ﬁCRISIL A1+ﬂ rating by CRISIL (which is the 
highest rating for the Short term instruments) and (b) Rating 
for Long Term Bank facilities were upgraded from ﬁCRISIL AA

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities 
under those Standards are further described in the Auditor™s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India 
(ICAI) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the 
provisions of 

the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements 
and the Code of Ethics. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the standalone 
financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial 

statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a 
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Key Audit Matters
Auditor™s response
1.
Industrial Promotion Scheme (IPS) receivable of 
R
 9,509 lakhs 
as at 
31
st
 March, 2021
Other current and non-current assets include government grant 

receivable in the form of refund of Sales tax/GST under IPS 

Scheme of 
R
 9,509 lakhs as at 
31
st
 March, 2021
 (
R
 7,929 lakhs 
as at 
31
st
 March, 2020
) from the states of Maharashtra, Madhya 
Pradesh, West Bengal and Rajasthan as per the respective 

schemes/ notifications announced/ issued by the aforesaid State 
Governments.
Post GST, the state of west Bengal is yet to notify the IPS scheme 
and accordingly, the Company has not recognized grant, since 

July 2017, in this regard. The amount whereof is presently not 

ascertainable. 
Management judgement is involved in assessing the accounting 
for grants and particularly in considering the probability of a 

grant being released and we have accordingly designated this 

as a focus area of the audit.
Audit procedures performed:
In response to the risk of completeness of the accruals in the 
standalone financial statements:
We have examined the eligibility certificates and obtained a list 
of year wise break- up of the IPS receivables by the Company 

for all the financial years. 
We had discussed the status of the assessment of grants receivable 
for all the financial years and the Management view on the 
expected time frame by which the grants will be released. 
Additionally, we have considered the status of the previous 
assessments and the adjustments, if any, done by the respective 

concerned authorities.
Based on the procedures performed, those gave us a sufficient 
evidence to conclude that the grants have been accounted in 
terms of the schemes/notifications announced/issued by various 
state governments.
Information Other than the Standalone Financial Statements and Auditor™s report thereon
The Company™s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of other information. The Other information comprises the information 
included in the Board™s Report including Annexures to the Board report, Business responsibility report, Corporate Governance report 
and Management Discussion and Analysis, but does not include the standalone financial statement and our auditor™s report thereon.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
61
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our knowledge obtained 
during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we required to 
report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management and those charged with Governance for the Standalone Financial Statements 
The Company™s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these 

standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance (including other comprehensive 
income), changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, 
including the accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act.
This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding 
of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate 
accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance 

of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting 
records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, the Management is responsible for assessing the Company™s ability to continue as a going 

concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management 
either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 
The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company™s financial reporting process.
Auditor™s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor™s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 
We also:


and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from 

error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 

circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has 

adequate internal financial control system in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. 

made by the management. 
Conclude on the appropriateness of Management™s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the entity™s ability 
to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our aud
itor™s 
report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 

Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor™s report. However, future events or conditions 
may cause the entity to cease to continue as a going concern.
 

whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the standalone financial statements that individually or in aggregate makes it probable 
that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the standalone financial statements may be influenced. We consider 
quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work and (ii) 
to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the standalone financial statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and 
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 

independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in 

our auditor™s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we 
determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be 
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
62
Other Matters:
We did not audit the financial statements of branches included in the standalone financial statements of the Company whose financial 
statements reflect the total assets of 
R
 272,664 Lakhs as at 31
st

R
 544,220 lakhs for the year ended 31
st
 March, 2020). The financial statements of 
these branches have been audited by the branch auditors whose reports have been furnished to us, and our opinion in so far as it relates 
to the amounts and disclosures included in respect of these branches, is based solely on the report of such branch auditors.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

Report on the Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 
of the Act
We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of the Supreme Industries Limited (ﬁthe Companyﬂ) as of 
 
31
st
 March, 2021 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.
Management™s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The Board of Directors of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal 
control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential component of internal control stated in 
the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of India (ICAI). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that 

were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company™s policies, the 
safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting 
records, 
and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditors™ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company™s internal financial controls over financial reporting based on our audit. We 

conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the ﬁGuidance 
Noteﬂ) and the Standards on Auditing deemed to be prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act to the extent applicable to an audit 
of internal financial controls, both applicable to an audit of internal financial controls and both issued by the ICAI. Those 
Standards and 
the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls operated 

effectively in all material respects. 
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system over 
financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining 
an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and 

evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the 
auditor™s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due 
to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company™s 
internal financial controls system over financial reporting.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting
A Company™s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of standalone financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. A Company™s internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures 
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of 

the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the entity are being made 
only in accordance with authorisations of management; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of 

unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity™s assets that could have a material effect on the standalone financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper 

management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections 
of any 
evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial 
control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the 

policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Company has, broadly in all material respects, 

an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were 
operating effectively as at 31
st
 March, 2021, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company 
considering the essential Component of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial 

Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

The preparation of the financial statements requires that the Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities as at the date of the financial statements 
and the 
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The recognition, measurement, classification or 
disclosure 

of an item or information in the financial statements is made relying on these estimates.
 
The estimates and judgements used in the preparation of the financial statements are continuously evaluated and are based on 
historical experience and various other assumptions and factors (including expectations of future events) that the Company 
believes 

to be reasonable under the existing circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Any revision to accounting 
estimates is recognised prospectively in current and future periods.
 
Current and non-current classification
 
All the assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-current as per the company™s normal operating cycle (not 
exceeding twelve months) and other criteria set out in Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013.
 
Areas involving critical estimates and Judgements are:
 
-
 
Estimation of employee defined benefit obligations (Refer note no. 1.12 below)

Freehold land is carried at historical cost. All other items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses, if any. Costs include freight, import duties, non-refundable purchase taxes and other expenses 

directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.
 
Subsequent costs are included in the asset™s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is 
probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured 

reliably. The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset is derecognized when replaced. All other repairs 
and maintenance are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss during the reporting period in which they are incurred.
 
Leasehold land is stated at historical cost less amounts written off proportionate to expired lease period.
 
Intangible Assets
 
Intangible assets are held on the balance sheet at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Intangible assets 
developed or acquired with finite useful life are amortized on straight line basis over the useful life as specified below:

Capital Work-in-progress and Pre-operative 
E
xpenses during Construction Period
 
Capital Work-in-Progress includes expenditure during construction period incurred on projects under implementation treated as 
pre-operative expenses pending allocation to the assets. These expenses are apportioned to the respective fixed assets on their 
completion / commencement of commercial production.
 
Depreciation/amortisation:
 
Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method applying the useful lives as prescribed in part C of Schedule II to the Companies 
Act, 2013. The range of estimated useful lives of Property, Plant & Equipment™s are as under:
Category
U
seful Life
Buildings (including roads)
3- 60 Years
Plant & Equipment*
7- 25 Years
Moulds & Dies*
2- 6 Years
Furniture & Fixture
10 Years
Office Equipment
3 - 5 Years
Vehicles
8 - 10 Years
 
* Useful life of Plant & Equipment of Plastic Piping System Division, Protective Packaging Division and Cross Laminated Film Division 
and Moulds and Dies are determined based on the internal assessment supported by independent technical evaluation carried out 
by external valuers.
 
The management believes that the useful life as given above the best represent the period over which the management expects to 
use these assets. The Company reviews the useful lives and residual value at each reporting date.
 
Depreciation on assets added/sold or discarded during the year is being provided on pro-rata basis up to the date on which such 
assets are added/sold or discarded. Leasehold Land is amortized over the period of lease.
 
Assets costing up to 
R
 10,000 each are depreciated fully in the year of purchase.
 
Gains/Losses on disposals/de-recognition of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying 
amount and these are recognized in statement of profit & Loss.
 
Assets held for sale
 
Non-current assets or disposal groups comprising of assets and liabilities are classified as ‚held for sale™ when all of the following 
criteria™s are met:
 
(i) 
 
decision has been made to sell.
 
(ii)
 
the assets are available for immediate sale in its present condition.
 
(iii) 
 
the assets are being actively marketed and
 
(iv) 
 
sale has been agreed or is expected to be concluded within 12 months of the Balance Sheet date.
 
Subsequently, such non-current assets and disposal groups classified as ‚held for sale™ are measured at the lower of its carrying value 
and fair value less costs to sell. Non-current assets held for sale are not depreciated or amortised.

IMPAIRM
E
N
T
 OF NON-FINANCIAL ASS
ET
S
 
The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a non-financial asset or a group of non-
financial assets are impaired. If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the amount of impairment loss. For the purpose 

of assessing impairment, the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely 
independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets is considered as a cash generating unit. If any such 
indication 
exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount of the individual asset/cash generating unit is made.
 
An impairment loss is calculated as the difference between an asset™s carrying amount and recoverable amount. Losses are recognised 
in profit or loss and reflected in an allowance account. When the Company considers that there are no realistic prospects of recovery 

of the asset, the relevant amounts are written off. If the amount of impairment loss subsequently decreases and the decrease can 
be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, then the previously recognised impairment loss is 
reversed through profit or loss.

the 
customer is able to direct the use of the transferred goods or services and obtains substantially all of the remaining benefits, provided 

a contract with enforceable rights and obligations exists and amongst others collectability of consideration is probable taking into 
account customer‚s creditworthiness.
 
Revenue is the transaction price the Company expects to be entitled to. In determining the transaction price, the Company 
considers 
effects of variable consideration, the existence of significant financing contracts, non cash consideration and consideration payable 
to the customer, if any.

ariable Consideration
 
If the consideration in a contract includes a variable amount, the company estimates the amount of consideration to which it will 
be entitled to in exchange for transferring goods to the customer. Some contracts with the customers provide them with a right 
to return and volume rebates. The right to return and volume rebates gives rise to variable consideration. The amount of 
variable 
consideration is calculated by either using the expected value or the most likely amount depending on which is expected to 
better 

predict the amount of variable consideration.
 
Sale of goods:
 Revenues are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods passes to the buyer, usually upon either at the 
time of dispatch or delivery. In case of export sale, it is usually recognised based on the shipped-on board date as per bill of lading. 
Revenue from sale of goods is net of taxes and recovery of charges collected from customers like transport, packing etc.
 
Sale of services:
 Revenues are recognized over time on a straight-line basis or, if the performance pattern is other than straight-line, 
as services are provided/rendered.
 
Other operating income: -
 Export Incentive under various schemes are accounted in the year of export.
 
Other Income
 
Dividend income on investments is recognised when the right to receive dividend is established.
 
Interest income is recognized on a time proportionate basis taking into account the amounts invested and the rate of interest. 
For 
all financial instruments measured at amortised cost, interest income is recorded using the Effective interest rate method to the net 
carrying amount of the financial assets.

rade Receivables:
 
A receivable represents the Company™s right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional (i.e. only a passage of time is 
required to before payment of the consideration is due).
 
Contract liabilities:
 
A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the company has received consideration 
(or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. If a customer pays consideration before the company transfer goods and 

services to the customer, a contract liability is recognised when the payment is made or the payment is due, whichever is earlier. 
Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the company performs under the contract.

Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received, and all attached conditio
ns 
will be complied with. Government grants related to revenue are recognised on a systematic basis in the statement of profit and loss 
over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs which they are intended to compensate. Such grants are deducted
 in 
reporting the related expense. When the grant relates to an asset, it is recognized as income over the expected useful life of 
the asset.
 
In case a non-monetary asset is given free of cost it is recognised at a fair value. When loan or similar assistance are provided by 
government or related institutions, with an interest rate below the current applicable market rate, the effect of this favorable interest 
is recognized as government grant. The loan or assistance is initially recognized and measured at fair value and the 
government grant 
is measured as the difference between the initial carrying value of the loan and the proceeds received.

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity 
instrument of 
another entity.
 
Financial assets - Initial recognition
 
Financial assets are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments. Financial assets 
other than trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value 
through profit or loss. Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction 
costs are expensed in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
 
Subsequent measurement
 
Financial assets, other than equity instruments, are subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive 
income or fair value through profit or loss on the basis of both:
  
(i) 
 
the entity™s business model for managing the financial assets and
  
(ii) 
 
the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.
 
(a) 
 
Measured at amortised cost:
  
A financial asset is measured at amortised cost, if it is held under the hold to collect business model i.e. held with an objective 
of holding the assets to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest 

on the principal outstanding. Amortised cost is calculated using the effective interest rate (ﬁEIRﬂ) method by taking into account 
any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is 
included 

in interest income in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss. On derecognition, gain or loss, if any, is recognised to Statement of Profit and Loss.
 
(b) 
 
Measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (F
V
OCI):
  
A financial asset is measured at FVOCI, if it is held under the hold to collect and sell business model i.e. held with an objective 
to collect contractual cash flows and selling such financial asset and the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal 

and interest on the principal outstanding. It is subsequently measured at fair value with fair value movements recognised in the 
OCI, except for interest income which recognised using EIR method. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the 

Statement of Profit and Loss. On derecognition, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the OCI is reclassified from the 
equity to Statement of Profit and Loss.
 
(c) 
 
Measured at fair value through profit or loss (F
VT
PL):
  
Investment in financial asset other than equity instrument, not measured at either amortised cost or FVOCI is measured at 
FVTPL. Such financial assets are measured at fair value with all changes in fair value, including interest income and dividend 

income if any, recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
 E
quity Instruments:
  
All investments in equity instruments classified under financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Equity instruments 

which are held for trading are measured at FVTPL.
  
For all other equity instruments, the Company may, on initial recognition, irrevocably elect to measure the same either at FVOCI or 
FVTPL. The Company makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Fair value changes on an equity instrument shall 
be recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss unless the Company has elected to measure such instrument at FVOCI. Fair value 
changes excluding dividends, on an equity instrument measured at FVOCI are recognised in the OCI. Amounts recognised in Other 
Comprehensive Income (OCI) are not subsequently transferred to Statement of Profit and Loss. Dividend income on the investments 
in equity instruments are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss.
  
Impairment
  
The Company recognises a loss allowance for Expected Credit Losses (ECL) on financial assets that are measured at amortised cost 

and at FVOCI. The credit loss is difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to an entity in accordance with the 
contract and all the cash flows that the entity expects to receive (i.e. all cash shortfalls), discounted at the original effective interest 
rate. This is assessed on an individual or collective basis after considering all reasonable and supportable including that which is 
forward-looking.
 
The Company™s trade receivables or contract revenue receivables do not contain significant financing Branch and loss allowance on 
trade receivables is measured at an amount equal to life time expected losses i.e. expected cash shortfall, being simplified approach 

for recognition of impairment loss allowance.
 
Under simplified approach, the Company does not track changes in credit risk. Rather it recognizes impairment loss allowance 
based on the lifetime ECL at each reporting date right from its initial recognition. The Company uses a provision matrix to determine 
impairment loss allowance on the portfolio of trade receivables.
Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31
st
 March, 2021
74
 
The provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivable and is adjusted 
for forward looking estimates. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-
looking estimates are analysed.
 
For financial assets other than trade receivables, the Company recognises 12-month expected credit losses for all originated or 
acquired financial assets if at the reporting date the credit risk of the financial asset has not increased significantly since its initial 
recognition. The expected credit losses are measured as lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on financial asset increases 
significantly since its initial recognition. If, in a subsequent period, credit quality of the instrument improves such that there is 
no longer significant increase in credit risks since initial recognition, then the Company reverts to recognizing impairment loss 

allowance based on 12 months ECL.
 
Impairment loss allowance including ECL or reversal recognized during the period is recognized as income/ expense in the Statement 
of Profit and Loss. This amount is reflected under the head ‚other expenses™ in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The impairment 
loss is presented as an allowance in the balance sheet as a reduction from the net carrying amount of the trade- receivable, loan, 
deposits and lease receivable respectively.
 
De-recognition
 
The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or 
it transfers rights to receive cash flows from an asset, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of 
ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control 

of the asset, the Company continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the Company™s continuing involvement. In 

that case, the Company also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a 

basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Company has retained.
 
Financial Liabilities
 
Initial Recognition and measurement
 
Financial liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments. Financial 
liabilities are initially recognised at fair value net of transaction costs for all financial liabilities not carried at fair 
value through profit 

or loss.
 
The Company™s financial liabilities includes trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts and derivative 
instruments.
 
Subsequent measurement
 
Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost are subsequently measured at using EIR method. Financial liabilities carried at fair 
value through profit or loss are measured at fair value with all changes in fair value recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
 
Loans & Borrowings
 
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using EIR method. 
Gains and losses are recognized in profit & loss when the liabilities are derecognized as well as through EIR amortization process. 

Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral 

part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of profit or loss.
 
Financial Guarantee Contracts
 
Financial guarantee contracts issued by the Company are those contracts that requires a payment to be made or to reimburse the 
holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtors fails to make payment when due in accordance with the term of a debt 

instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are recognized initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are 

directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. Subsequently the liability is measured at the higher of the amount of loss 

allowance determined as per impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 and the amount recognized less cumulative adjustments.
 
De-recognition
 
A financial liability is de-recognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing 
financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are 

substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition 

of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
 
Derivative financial instruments & hedge accounting
 
The Company uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge its foreign currency 
risks. 
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into 

and are subsequently remeasured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss. Derivatives are 
carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.
 
The Company designates their derivatives as hedges of foreign currency risk associated with the cash flows of highly probable 
forecast transactions and variable interest rate risks associated with the borrowings.
 
The Company documents at the inception of hedging transaction the economic relationship between hedging instruments and 
hedged items including whether the hedging instrument is expected to offset cash flow of hedged items. The Company documents 
its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transaction at the inception of each hedge relationship.
Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31
st

Cash flows hedge that qualify for the hedge accounting
 
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to statement of profit & loss, except for the 
effective portion of cash flow hedge which is recognized in other comprehensive income and presented as separate Branch of equity 
which is later reclassified to statement of profit & loss when the hedge item affects profit & loss.
 
Offsetting of financial instruments
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are off-set, and the net amount is reported in the Balance Sheet if there is a currently 
enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and 
settle the liabilities simultaneously.

The Company measures financial instruments, such as, derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet date.
 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the 
asset 
or transfer the liability takes place either:
 
- In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
 
- In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability
 
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Company.
 
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing 
the asset 
or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
 
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant™s ability to generate economic benefits by 
using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its 
highest and best 

use.
 
The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to 
measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
 
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within 
the fair value 
hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
 
Level 1 -
 Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
 
Level 2 - 
Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly 
observable
 
Level 3 - 
Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable
 
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether 
transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is 

significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period. For the purpose of fair value disclosures, 
the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the 
asset or liability 

and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.

Defined benefit plans such a gratuity and
 
(b) 
 
Defined contribution plans such as Provident fund & Superannuation fund
 
a) 
 
Defined-benefit plan:
 
 
The liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit gratuity plan is the present value of defined 

benefit obligations at the end of the reporting period less fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligations is 
calculated 
annually by actuaries through actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method.
  
The Company recognises the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation as an expense in the statement of profit 
and loss:
  
(a) 
 
Service costs comprising current service costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailment and non-routine 

settlements; and

are recognised in the period in which they occur directly in Other comprehensive income. Re-measurement are not reclassified 
to profit or loss in subsequent periods.
  
Ind AS 19 requires the exercise of judgment in relation to various assumptions including future pay rises, inflation and discount 
rates and employee and pensioner demographics. The Company determines the assumptions in conjunction with its actuaries, 

and believes these assumptions to be in line with best practice, but the application of different assumptions could have a 

significant effect on the amounts reflected in the income statement, other comprehensive income and balance sheet. There 

may be also interdependency between some of the assumptions.
 
b) 
 
Defined-contribution plan:
  
Under defined contribution plans, provident fund, the Company pays pre-defined amounts to separate funds and does not 
have any legal or informal obligation to pay additional sums. Defined Contribution plan comprise of contributions to the 

employees™ provident fund with the government, superannuation fund and certain state plans like Employees™ State Insurance 

and Employees™ Pension Scheme. The Company™s payments to the defined contribution plans are recognised as expenses 
during the period in which the employees perform the services that the payment covers.
 
c) 
 
Other employee benefits:
 
 
(i) 
 
Compensated absences which are not expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the 
employee renders the related services are recognised as a liability at the present value of the obligation as at the Balance 
sheet date determined based on an actuarial valuation.
  
(ii) 
 
Undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the services rendered by 
employees are recognised during the period when the employee renders the related services.
 
d)
 
 
Expenses incurred towards voluntary retirement scheme are charged to the statement of profit and loss as and when incurred.

As a Lessee:
 
The Company™s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for land, buildings and vehicles. The Company assesses whether a 
contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the 

use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
 
To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether:
 
(i) 
 
the contract involves the use of an identified asset;
 
(ii) 
 
the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease; and
 
(iii) 
 
the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.
 
At the date of commencement of the lease, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset (ﬁROUﬂ) and a corresponding lease liability 
for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low 

value leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a 

straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
 
The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease 
payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are 

subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
 
Certain lease arrangements includes the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets and 
lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.
 
Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and 
useful life of the underlying asset. Right of use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. 
the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not 
generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for 
the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.
 
The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease 
payments are 
discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates in the 
country of domicile of these leases. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset 
if the Company changes its assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option.
 
Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as 
financing cash flows.
 
As a Lessor:
 
Lease income from operating leases where the Company is a lessor is recognised in income on a straight-line basis over the leas
e term 
unless the receipts are structured to increase in line with expected general inflation to compensate for the expected inflation
ary cost 
increases. The respective leased assets are included in the balance sheet based on their nature.

in the fair value of the item. Exchange differences arising out of these transactions are charged to the Statement of Profit and

The income tax expense or credit for the period is the tax payable on the current period™s taxable income based on the applicable 
income tax rate adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax 
losses, if any.
 
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognized in the statement of profit and loss except to 
the extent it relates to items directly recognized in equity or in other comprehensive income. In this case, the tax expense is also 
recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, as the case may be.
 
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit is different from accounting profit due to temporary differences 
between accounting and tax treatments, and due to items, that are never taxable or tax deductible. Current tax is measured at the 

amount expected to be paid to the tax authorities in accordance with the taxation laws prevailing and applicable for the relevant 

assessment year.
 
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) 
that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related 
deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
 
The Company offsets, the tax assets and liabilities (on a year on year basis) where it has a legally enforceable right and where it 
intends to settle such assets and liabilities on a net basis or to realise the assets and liabilities on net basis.
 
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilized. Deferred 
income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or 

the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

A provision is recognised when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past event; it is probable that an 
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and in respect of which a reliable estimate can be made. These are 

reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.
 
A disclosure for a contingent liability is made where there is a possible obligation arising out of past event, the existence 
of which 
will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control 

of the Company or a present obligation arising out of past event where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be 

required to settle or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made.
 
Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized when the expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower 
than the unavoidable costs of meeting the future obligations under the contract.
 
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when 
appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is 

recognised as a finance cost.

The Management assessed that cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables and other current liabilities 
approximate 
their carrying amounts largely due to the short term maturities of these instruments. The fair value of the financial assets and financial 
liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, 
other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
 
T
he Company uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation 
technique:
 
Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
 
Level 2: Other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either 
directly or indirectly.
 
Level 3: Techniques which use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable 
market data.

Fair value estimation
  
For financial instruments measured at fair value in the Balance Sheet, a three level fair value hierarchy is used that reflects 
the significance of inputs used in the measurements. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in 
active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 

measurements).
  
The categories used are as follows:







Level 1
Level 2
Level 3

Financial risk management objectives and policies
 
 
The Company™s financial risk management is an integral part of how to plan and execute its business strategies. The Company™s 
activity expose it to market risk, liquidity risk , commodity risk and credit risk. In order to minimise any adverse effects 
on the 

financial performance of the Company, derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts are entered 

to hedge certain foreign currency risk exposures. Derivatives are used exclusively for hedging purposes and not as trading or 
speculative instruments. The Company™s financial risk management policy is set by the Managing Director and governed by overall 
direction of Board of Directors of the Company.
91
 
Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash flows that may result from a change in the price of a financial 
instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency 
exchange 
rates, equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to 
all market risk 
sensitive financial instruments including investments and deposits, foreign currency receivables, payables and loans and borrowings.

 RISK
  
Credit risk arises from the possibility that the counter party may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To manage this, 

the Company periodically assess financial reliability of customers, taking into account the financial condition, current 
economic 
trends, and analysis of historical bad debts and ageing of accounts receivable. Individual risk limits are set accordingly.
  
The Company considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of asset and whether there has been a significant 
increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis through each reporting period. To assess whether there is a significant increase in 

credit risk the Company compares the risk of default occurring on asset as at the reporting date with the risk of default as 
at the 
date of initial recognition. It considers reasonable and supportive forwarding-looking information such as:
  
i) 
 
Actual or expected significant adverse changes in business
  
ii) 
 
Actual or expected significant changes in the operating results of the counterparty
  
iii) 
 
Financial or economic conditions that are expected to cause a significant change to the counterparty™s ability to meet its 

obligations
  
iv) 
 
Significant increase in credit risk on other financial instruments of the same counterparty
  
The company catogarises financial assets based on the assumptions, inputs and factors specific to the class of financial assets 
into High-quality assets, negligible credit risk; Quality assets, low credit risk; Standard assets, moderate credit risk; Substandard 
assets, relatively high credit risk; Low quality assets, very high credit risk; Doubtful assets, credit-impaired.
  
Financial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectations of recovery, such as a debtor failing to engage in a 
repayment plan with the Company. The Company categorises a loan or receivable for write off when a debtor fails to make 
contractual payments greater than one year past due. Where loans or receivables have been written off, the Company continues 
engage in enforcement activity to attempt to recover the receivable due. Where recoveries are made, these are recognized in 

profit or loss.

The sensitivity analyses above have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions 
occurring at the end of the reporting year and may not be representative of the actual change. It is based on a change in 
the key assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. When calculating the sensitivity to the assumption, the 

same method used to calculate the liability recognised in the balance sheet has been applied. The methods and types of 
assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared with the previous year.

The Company permits encashment of compensated absence accumulated by their employees on 
retirement, separation and during the course of service. The liability in respect of the Company, for outstanding balance 
of leave at the balance sheet date is determined and provided on the basis of actuarial valuation as at the balance sheet 
date performed by an independent actuary. The Company doesn™t maintain any plan assets to fund its obligation towards 

compensated absences.

Effective April 1, 2019, the Company had adopted Ind AS 116 ﬁLeasesﬂ using modified retrospective approach. The Company™s 
lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for buildings and vehicles. These leases were classified as ﬁOperating Leasesﬂ under 

Ind AS 17. On transition to Ind AS 116 ﬁLeasesﬂ, for these leases, lease liabilities were measured at the present value of remaining 
lease payments, discounted at the Company™s incremental borrowing rate as at April 01, 2019. Right to Use is measured either at 

an amount equal to the lease liability adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments.
 
The Company had used following practical expedient, when applying Ind AS 116 to leases previously classified as operating leases 
under Ind AS 17.
 
 
The company didn™t recognized Right to Use and Lease liabilities for lease for which the lease terms ends within 12 months on 

the date of initial transition and low value assets
 
 
The Company excluded initial direct cost from measurement of the Right to Use assets at the date of initial application.
 
 
The Company uses hindsight in determining the lease term where the contract contains options to extend or terminate the 

lease.
 
Under Ind AS 116, the nature of expenses in respect of operating leases has changed from ﬁlease rentﬂ to ﬁdepreciation costﬂ and 
‚™finance cost™™ for the right-to-use assets and for interest accrued on lease liability respectively, and therefore, these expenses for the 

current year are not comparable to the previous years, to that extent.
 
The weighted average lessee™s incremental borrowing rate applied to the lease liabilities is 9% p.a.

Notes:
 
a) 
 
Most of the issues of litigation pertaining to Central Excise/Income Tax are based on interpretation of the respective Law & Rules 
thereunder. Management has been opined by its counsel that many of the issues raised by revenue will not be sustainable in law 
as they are covered by judgments of respective judicial authorities which supports its contention. As such no material impact 

on the financials of the Company is envisaged. 
 
b) 
 
Sales Tax and Entry Tax related litigation/demand primarily pertains to non-receipt of declaration forms from customers and 

mismatch of input tax credit or some interpretation related issues w.r.t. applicability of schemes. Counsel of the Company 
opined positive outcome based on merits of the cases under litigation. As such no material impact on the financials of the 
Company is envisaged.
 
c) 
 
Other issues are either in ordinary course of business or not of substantial nature and management is reasonably confident of 
their positive outcome. Management shall deal with them judiciously and provide for appropriately, if any such need arises.

Independent Auditors™ Report on Consolidated Financial Statements
To the Members of 
 
The Supreme Industries Limited
Report on the Audit of Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of The Supreme Industries Limited (ﬁthe Parent Companyﬂ), its 
wholly owned foreign subsidiary and its associate (hereinafter to be referred as ﬁthe Groupﬂ) which comprises of consolidated Balance 

Sheet as at 31
st
 March, 2021, the consolidated statement of Profit & Loss (including other comprehensive income), the consolidated 
Statement of changes in equity and the consolidated Statement of cash flow for the year than ended, and notes to the financial statements, 

including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are included the financial 
statements 
of 24 manufacturing units  (including 28 - Depots, 8 - Fabrication units and 6 - Offices) located across India [hereinafter referred to as 
ﬁBranchesﬂ] for the year ended on that date audited by 9 branch auditors.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid consolidated  financial 
statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the Act)  in the manner so required and give a true and fair view 
in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group  as at 31
st
 March, 
2021, the consolidated profit (including other comprehensive income), consolidated changes in equity and its consolidated cash flows 

for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under 

section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor™s Responsibilities for the Audit 

of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of 
Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit 
of the consolidated financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other 

ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. 
We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred 
to in Other Matter paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a 

whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Key Audit Matters
Auditor™s response
1.
Industrial Promotion Scheme (IPS) receivable of 
 
R
 9,509 lakhs as at 31
st
 March, 2021 
Other current and non-current assets include government 
grant receivable in the form of refund of Sales tax/GST under 
IPS Scheme of 
R
 9,509 lakhs as at 31
st
 March, 2021  (
R
 7,929 
lakhs as at 31
st
 March, 2020) from the states of Maharashtra, 
Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Rajasthan as per the 

respective schemes/ notifications announced/ issued by the 
aforesaid State Governments.
Post GST, the state of west Bengal is yet to notify the IPS 
scheme and accordingly, the Company has not recognized 

grant, since July 2017, in this regard. The amount whereof 
is presently not ascertainable. 
Management judgement is involved in assessing the 
accounting for grants and particularly in considering the 

probability of a grant being released and we have accordingly 
designated this as a focus area of the audit.
Audit Procedure performed:
In response to the risk of completeness of the accruals in the 
standalone financial statements:
We have examined the eligibility certificates and obtained a list 
of year wise break- up of the IPS receivables by the Company 

for all the financial years. 
We had discussed the status of the assessment of grants 
receivable for all the financial years and the Management view 
on the expected time frame by which the grants will be released. 
Additionally, we have considered the status of the previous 
assessments and the adjustments, if any, done by the respective 
concerned authorities.
The procedures performed gave us a sufficient evidence to 
conclude that the grants have been accounted in terms of the 

schemes announced by various state governments.
103
Information Other than the Consolidated Financial Statements and auditor™s report thereon
The Company™s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of other information. The Other information comprises the information 
included in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Board™s Report including Annexures to the Board report, Business responsibility 
Report, Corporate Governance report and Shareholder™s information, but does not include the consolidated financial statement and our 
auditor™s report thereon.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of 
assurance 
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained 
during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we required to 
report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management for the Consolidated Financial Statements 
The Parent Company™s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation 

of these consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial 
performance (including other comprehensive income), consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group in 
accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the accounting Standards specified under section 133 

of the Act.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting 
records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds 
and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating 
effectively for 

ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolida
ted 
financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have 
been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the Directors of the Parent Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Board of Directors of the Companies included in the Group are responsible 
for assessing the ability of the companies to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, 
or has 

no realistic alternative but to do so. 
The respective Board of Directors of the Companies included in the Group are also responsible for overseeing the financial reporting 
process of the Group.
Auditor™s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor™s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level 
of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement w
hen it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 
We also:
 
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 
 
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in 
the 
circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has 
adequate internal financial control system in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. 
 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by the management. 
 
Conclude on the appropriateness of Management™s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the entity™s ability 

to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor™s 

report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our 
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor™s report. However, future events 
or conditions may cause the entity to cease to continue as a going concern. 
 
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair 

presentation.
104
 
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group 
to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of 
the audit of the financial statements of such entities included in the consolidated financial statements of which we are independent 
auditors. For the other entities included in the consolidated financial statements, which have been audited by other auditors, such 

other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain 
solely responsible for our audit opinion.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the consolidated financial statements that individually or in aggregate makes it probable 
that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the consolidated financial statements may be influenced. We consider 

quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work and (ii) 
to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the consolidated financial statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance of the Parent Company of which we are the independent auditors regarding, 
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in 
internal control that we identify during our audit. 
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in 

our auditor™s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we 
determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be 
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Other Matters:
(a)
 
We did not audit the financial statements the branches included in the consolidated financial statements of the group whose 
financial statements reflects total assets of 
R
 272,664 lakhs as at 31
st
 March, 2021 (
R
 283,044 lakhs as at 31
st
 March, 2020) and total 
revenue of 
R
 617,306 lakhs for the year ended on that date (
R
 544,220 lakhs for the year ended 31
st
 March, 2020), as considered 
in the consolidated financial statements. The financial statements of these branches have been audited by the 9 branch 
auditors 
whose reports have been furnished to us, and our opinion in so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in respect

BASIS OF PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries and associates as at 
 
31 March 2021. The Parent Company prepares and report its consolidated financial statements in INR (
R
).
 
Subsidiaries:
 
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the group has control. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to 
variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. 

Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has:
 
 
 
Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee)
Consolidated Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31
st
 March, 2021
111
 
 
 
Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and
 
 
 
The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns
 
The group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more 
of the three elements of controls. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the group obtains control over the subsidiary and 
ceases 
when the group losses control of the subsidiary.
 
Consolidation procedure:
 
Subsidiaries:
 
a)
 
 Combine, on line by line basis like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of the parent with those 
of its subsidiaries. For this purpose, income and expenses of the subsidiary are based on the amounts of the assets and liabilities 

recognised in the consolidated financial statements at the acquisition date.
 
b) 
 
Offset (eliminate) the carrying amount of the parent™s investment in each subsidiary and the parent™s portion of equity of 
each 
subsidiary. Business combinations policy explains how to account for any related goodwill.
 
c) 
 
Eliminate in full intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between 

entities of the group (profits or losses resulting from intragroup transactions that are recognised in assets, such as inventory and 
fixed assets, are eliminated in full). Intragroup losses may indicate an impairment that requires recognition in the consolidated 

financial statements. Ind AS12 Income Taxes applies to temporary differences that arise from the elimination of profits and 
losses resulting from intragroup transactions.
 
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the Company and to the 
non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-
controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
 
Consolidated financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar 
circumstances. If a member of the group uses accounting policies other than those adopted in the consolidated financial statements 

for like transactions and events in similar circumstances, appropriate adjustments are made to that group member™s financial 

statements in preparing the consolidated financial statements to ensure conformity with the group™s accounting policies.
 
The financial statements of all entities used for the purpose of consolidation are drawn up to same reporting date as that of the 
parent company, i.e., year ended on 31 March. When the end of the reporting period of the parent is different from that of a 

subsidiary, the subsidiary prepares, for consolidation purposes, additional financial information as of the same date as the financial 
statements of the parent to enable the parent to consolidate the financial information of the subsidiary, unless it is impracticable to 
do so.
1.5
 
GOODWILL
 
Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is initially recognized at cost at the date of acquisition. After initial recognition, 
goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any.
1.6
 
INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES
 
Associates are all entities over which the group has significant influences but not control or joint control. This is generally the case 
where the group holds between 20% to 50% of the voting rights or the group has power to participate in the financial and operating 
policy decision of the investee. Investments in associate are accounted for using equity method accounting.
 
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method 
of accounting, except when the investment, or a portion thereof, is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in 

accordance with Ind AS 105.
 
Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognised in the consolidated balance sheet at cost and adjusted 
thereafter to recognise the Group™s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate.
 
On acquisition of the investment in an associate, any excess of the cost of the investment over the Group™s share of the net fair 
value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee is recognised as goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount 
of the investment. Any excess of the Group™s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities over the cost of the 

investment, after reassessment, is recognised directly in equity as capital reserve in the period in which the investment is acquired.
 
Distributions received from an associate reduce the carrying amount of the investment. Unrealised gains on transactions 
between 
the group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the group™s interest in these entities. Unrealised losses 

are also eliminated unless the transactions provides evidence of an impairment of the assets transferred.
 
When the Group™s share of losses of an associate exceeds the Group™s interest in that associate (which includes any long-term 
interests that, in substance, form part of the Group™s net investment in the associate), the Group discontinues recognising its share 

of further losses. Additional losses are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or 
made payments on behalf of the associate.

st

Change in Ownership Interest:
 
When the Group ceases to consolidate or equity account for an investment because of a loss of control or significant influence, any 
retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value with the change in carrying amount recognized in profit or loss. This fair 
value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequent accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint 
venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity 

are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously 
recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss. If the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but 
significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income 

are reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.
      
1.7
 
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS
 
In preparing the financial statements of each individual group entity, transactions in currencies other than the entity™s functional 
currency (foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each 
reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-
monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date 

when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not 
retranslated.
 
Exchange differences on monetary items are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise except for exchange 
differences on monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to 
occur (therefore forming part of the net investment in the foreign operation), which are recognised initially in other 
comprehensive 
income and reclassified from equity to profit or loss on repayment of the monetary items.
 
For the purposes of presenting these consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group™s foreign operations 
are translated into Indian Rupees using exchange rates prevailing at the end of each reporting period. Income and expense items 
are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which 
case the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions are used.
     
 
Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity (and attributed to 
non-controlling interests as appropriate).
     
 
On disposal of foreign operations (i.e. a disposal of the Group™s entire interest in a foreign operation, a disposal involving loss 
of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, or a partial disposal of an interest in a joint arrangement or an 
associate that includes a foreign operation of which the retained interest becomes a financial asset), all of the exchange differences 
accumulated in equity in respect of that operation attributable to the owners of the Group are reclassified to profit or loss.
 
In addition, in relation to a partial disposal of a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation that does not result in the Group 
losing control over the subsidiary, the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences are re-attributed to non-controlling 
interests and are not recognised in profit or loss. For all other partial disposals (i.e. partial disposals of associates or joint arrangements 
that do not result in the Group losing significant influence or joint control), the proportionate share of the accumulated exchange 
differences is reclassified to profit or loss.
1.8
 
SEGMENT REPORTING
 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to Chief Operating Decision Maker 
(CODM).
 
The Group has identified its Managing Director as CODM which assesses the operational performance and position of the Group 
and makes strategic decisions.
