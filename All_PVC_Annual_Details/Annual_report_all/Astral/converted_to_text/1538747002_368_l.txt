Management Speaks
To continue the growth journey that Astral has seen over the years, as communicated earlier, the 
capital allocation is very important for all of us. Astral being a responsible corporate house on 
growth trajectory, we always try to judiciously allocate the money for growth rather than to be 
either a debt-free company or sitting on cash to maximise the returns for our shareholders. 
Astral is always on lookout for growth and expansion opportunities, and as long as profitable 
growth avenues are available in the similar or relevant sector to leverage the Brand & Network, we 
will continuously keep deploying the capital and will try to maximise the returns for our 
shareholders. We made the right decision of entering into Adhesive Business 3 years before and 
now we are entering into Double Wall Corrugated (DWC ) pipes and Infrastructure space through 
inorganic way and we feel this new category will take the company to a new height in terms of 
growth and profitability while expanding the offerings for the market.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
I.
Economic Scenario
India™s growth (GDP) for the year was 6.6%, considerably below the expectations, on account of the c
hallenges of GST
implementation and Demonetisation. However, as per the Asian Development Bank, the GDP forecast for 
the year 2018 is
7.30% and for 2019 is 7.6%, which is a very healthy estimate. The Government of India is forecasting
 even higher figures than
these.
Overall, the economic environment looks good. However, many challenges in the form of Crude Price, I
nflation, Currency war
and Global Trade Wars, are envisaged. Inspite of these challenges, the underlying sentiment foresees
 that the Indian Macros
may do well and the country will more likely grow by more than 7%, which can be termed as a healthy 
growth for the country by
any standard.
Construction activity within the country has started growing slowly and it will pickup pace in the c
oming years, which will be the
real positive factor for the county as many industries are associated with the construction activity
. Now problems related to
RERA are almost resolved and things have started moving in the right direction. Govt. is spending si
zeable amount on the
infrastructure activities, which is going to help to grow the economy in the coming years.
MET department has also forecasted a normal monsoon which will help to augment the farmers™ income a
nd the rural economy
is expected to do better in the year 2018-19. GST collection is likely to improve and the shift from
 unorganised to organised
sector is going to help improve the tax collection figures which in turn will not only help the Gove
rnment but also the economy
in the years ahead.
II.
Industry Scenario - Plastic Piping & Adhesives Industry
Plastic Pipes :
From the year 2012 to 2017, the piping industry in India has grown by 10%-12% CAGR and attained the 
size of 
`
 250 Billion
(Crisil Report). The main reason for the growth in the demand was increased construction and irrigat
ion activities and replacement
of metal by plastic.
Several Govt. schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY), Accelerated Irrigation
 Benefits Programme
(AIBP), Command Area Development and Water Management Programme, Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and U
rban
Transformation (AMRUT) etc. are helping to accelerate the demand for pipes for drinking water, sewer
age water, waste and rain
water etc. As per the CRISIL forecast for 2017-2022, Plastic Pipes & Fitting Industry will post a CA
GR of 12-14% reaching market
size of 
`
 460 Billion in India. The main contributors to the growth are:
01)
Low Per Capita Plastic Consumption :
India™s per capita consumption is just 11 Kg compared to global average of 30 kgs.
02)
Substitution and Replacement Demand and increase in CPVC market :
Due to inherent advantages of plastic v/s metal, the usage of plastic pipes is increasing and recent
ly due to lower crude
price the shift is getting faster from metal to plastic. Also within the polymer, the usage of CPVC 
is increasing continuously.
As per the CRISIL estimate, CPVC is expected to grow at a CAGR of 24-25% by 2021-22. The overall sha
re of CPVC pipes
which was 12% within the Pipe Industry in 2016-17, would go up to 20% by 2022. Also, the demand is c
oming from
replacement of older plastic pipes with the new polymer pipes.
03)
Announcement of Various Govt. Schemes :
Central Government has put increased thrust on several schemes to augment irrigation, urban infrastr
ucture and real
estate etc. as already mentioned above.
04)
Real Estate Demand
a)
Growth in Population:
 Country™s population is expected to grow at 1.6% CAGR, by 2020-21, which will be about 1.4
billion, resulting in increased housing demand.
b)
Urbanisation:
 Urbanisation which was 31% till 2011 is expected to be 36% by 2020, driving the demand for housing.
c)
Traction in Tier II and III Cities: 
There is continuous pick up in demand for plastic pipes in Tier II and Tier III cities
mainly because of increase in per capita income.
d)
Surging demand from Rural Sector: 
Due to various government schemes, the disposable income of farmers is
increasing. Sustained marketing efforts and implementation of GST will help the branded players to i
ncrease the rural
penetration.
e)
Higher affordability led by increase in disposable income: 
Increase in Disposable income has a positive correlation
with demand for housing units.
18
f)
Tax Incentive by Govt.: 
Incentives like interest subvention, interest deduction from tax income, tax exemption on
principal repayment, exemption from capital gains etc., will help the housing sector and in turn the
 piping industry.
g)
Increase in Availability of Finance:
 Finance penetration to urban area which was 42.3% in FY 2016-2017,is likely to
be 44.8% by FY 2018-2019, which will help to increase real estate demand.
III.
Piping Business Developments:
Year 2017-18 was full of challenges. On one hand, GST regime was implemented and on the other hand t
here was significant
slowdown in the real-estate sector. In spite of these challenges, your company was able to generate 
a volume growth of 16%,
which was the highest in the last 3 years though the Industry growth of piping segment was very low.
 Company not only
focussed on the volume growth but also improved the Gross Margin from 28.78 % to 32.60% and EBIDTA m
argin also improved
from 14.58% to 15.39%. Due to lower price of crude in International markets and appreciation of curr
ency, the price of polymer
was low during the year. Hence your company was able to deliver a value growth of 9%. The backward i
ntegration of CPVC
polymer helped the company to grow the volume and improve the Gross Margin.
1)
Plants
Ghiloth Plant
: Your company has successfully completed the construction of the plant and installed the machinerie
s. The
total production capacity of the plant is 22,700 M.T. The plant will be operational in the July 2018
 once all the regulatory
approvals are obtained. The company will be able to save on logistics cost in the North and North-Ea
st region and will be
able to expand its footprints in the region where the presence of the company is low or nearly absen
t.
Hosur Plant:
 Expansion of the facility at Hosur (Tamil Nadu) is in advanced stage. Construction will be complete
d before
September and the company is planning to add Approx. 20,000 M.T. capacity. With this expanded capaci
ty, company will
be able to take care of most of its requirement of the southern region and the company will add many
 new distributors in
the region as it will be able to take advantage of reduced logistic costs.
2)
Products
Your company has continuously invested money in its R & D activities and as a result, the company ha
s been able to add
new products to its basket. Consistent innovation is the key to the growth of any organization. We a
lways believe that with
a strong R & D team, experienced professionals and visionaries at the top, the company will always b
e ready for the next
level of products and growth.
After the successful implementation of backward integration of CPVC compound at Gujarat plant and th
en the southern
plant, your company is planning to add few more products to its basket. Your company has recently la
unched 
ﬁRECYFIXﬂ
for comprehensive range of surface drainage system, 
ﬁPEX-A-PROﬂ
 for advanced, next generation plumbing system for
hot and cold water, 
ﬁINSUPROﬂ
 for XLPE insulation for hot and cold water piping as well as for HVAC etc. the company is
shortly going to launch 
ﬁDOUBLE WALL CORRUAGTEDﬂ
 (DWC) pipes for sewage and drainage application. These products
have a very bright future.
3)
Distribution Network
Your company is consistently adding new distributors to its portfolio. As of today, the company has 
750+ distributors and
28,000+ dealers across the country. This year, the focus was on increasing the dealer™s network.
Further, the company is going to start the Rajasthan Plant whereafter, it is planning to add more di
stributors and dealers in
North India. The company is also increasing the capacity of the Southern plant where the company is 
planning to add new
Distributors and dealers.
The launch of new products will attract new distributors for the new product range. In a nutshell, t
he company is planning
to significantly enlarge the Distribution Network in the coming years.
4)
Branding Initiatives
Your company is consistently investing in Brand creation on a year on year basis. Your company™s bra
nding activities involve
national television advertisement, in-film branding, train/bus/auto banners, advertisement hoardings
, sports sponsorship,
shop hoarding boards; plumber/architects/distributors meet etc. Your company believes in brand build
ing and creating
awareness about the importance of good quality pipes in the construction of a building. We are also 
conducting meets for
plumbers and consultants for creating the awareness. During FY 2017-18, in-film branding was carried
 out in the film
ﬁ
Toilet Ek Prem Katha
ﬂ with Bollywood star 
Akshaykumar.
 Participation in the various national and international exhibitions
is being carried out aggressively to promote new products. For sports branding, your company has bec
ome associate
sponsor of ﬁ
Sunrisers Hyderabadﬂ
 and ﬁ
Rajasthan Royalﬂ
 teams in Indian Premier League 
(IPL) 
2018.
5)
Goods and Service Tax (GST)
GST is considered to be the biggest tax reform in the country post independence with an intention to
 increase tax compliance
and widen the tax base. GST is considered to be positive for organized players like your Company and
 to create an opportunity
for organized players to replace the market share of unorganized players. Under GST, price of unorga
nized players will
19
decreased drastically and hence, eventually the level of competition will be determined by quality, 
brand and market
reach. Share of unorganized sectors in the Indian Plastic Piping industry is estimated at around 40%
, which we expect, will
gradually move to the organized sector sizeably.
Your company has successfully implemented the GST related changes and connected with all the Distrib
utors across the
country and the systems are working very effectively. We foresee that this reform is going to help t
he company in the long
run and sizeable business shift will take place from unorganised to the organised sector in the comi
ng 5 to 7 years.
IV.
Adhesives Business Developments:
Adhesive business of the company is growing steadily at the domestic level and delivering good margi
ns. Last year domestic
business has grew by 20.3% in value terms and EBDITA margin also improved as compared to the previou
s year from 16.0% to
19.1%. Though the margins are very robust, it has to be seen how the high margins can be sustained i
n a rising raw material
price scenario.
Overall, the contribution from the existing products is statisfactory and steady growth is registere
d. Inspite of the fact that the
economic scenario is not very encouraging, your company has been able to maintain a reasonably good 
growth and going
forward we foresee that the growth momentum will continue. The company is also continuously introduc
ing a range of new
adhesives & sealants.
The Recent Launch of 
ﬁRESIQUICKﬂ
 the instant joint glue ŒCynoacrylic has been very well received in the market.
The overseas adhesive sales has grown by 6.2% . The EBDITA was 5.7% mainly because of the lower perf
ormance of US subsidiary.
However, we are forseeing that in the year 2018-19, the growth will be better and there will be impr
ovement in the margins.
The Company is also planning to introduce the US product in India in the second half of the FY 2018-
19.
1)
Plants
The Company is continuously upgrading the packaging facilities at all the locations and a result com
pany has incurred
sizeable capex for the same. Company has also incurred sizeable capex for new products such as ‚RESI
QUICKﬂ, which has
already been introduced in the market, and other products in building chemicals segment.
Last year the company has spent 
`
 5,632 Lacs by way of Capex and invested sizeable amount in the state of the art R & D
facility at its Santej Plant, which is now operational. Company is hiring rich talent for its R&D fa
cility and planning to develop
many new products in different chemical segment.
In the US entity, the company has incurred capex to replace the old machines and in UK, the company 
has purchased the
new adjacent premises which will facilitate its future growth and committed total capex of 
`
 1,384 Lacs.
The company has done sizeable expansion and has enough capacity to double its business without any f
urther capex.
2)
New products
Your company believes in continuously adding to the product range in the adhesive basket and as a pa
rt of that strategy,
the company is investing in R&D facilities.In this context, the launch of ﬁRESIQUICKﬂ and few others
 products in building
chemical space are noteworthy.
3)
Branding
Your company has aggressively commenced branding activity, which includes shop-branding, exhibitions
, sports branding
and distributors meet. Resinova has initiated shop branding in all major cities for extensive brand 
presence. For sports
branding, Resinova has become associate sponsor of ﬁ
Sunrisers Hyderabadﬂ
 
team 
in Indian Premier League 
(IPL) 2018
.
Your company is also now planning to do major branding activity on 
Social Media and TVC
 in the near future.
4)
Distribution Network
Your company has changed its policy and now it targets to appoint big-ticket distributors for its va
rious products. The
company has already appointed sizeable number of large distributors in all the four zones of the cou
ntry, which is likely to
yield good results in coming years.
Similarly, with the launch of 
ﬁREISQUICKﬂ, 
the company will be adding many retail counters and touch points, which will
increase the brand image and reach of the company products within the country. The company is also p
lanning to engage
in social media branding activity increasing the reach of the product to every nook and corner of th
e country.

Annexure 2 to The Independent Auditor™s Report of even date on the Ind AS Financial
Statements of Astral Poly Technik Limited
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Co
mpanies Act, 2013 (ﬁthe
Actﬂ)
We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of Astral Poly Technik Limi
ted (ﬁthe Companyﬂ) as of March 31,
2018 in conjunction with our audit of the Ind AS financial statements of the Company for the year en
ded on that date.
Management™s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The Company™s Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls
 based on the internal control
over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of
 internal control stated in the
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the Institu
te of Chartered Accountants of
India. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate interna
l financial controls that were
operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adhe
rence to the Company™s policies, the
safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and comp
leteness of the accounting
records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditor™s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company™s internal financial controls over financ
ial reporting based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls ove
r Financial Reporting (the
ﬁGuidance Noteﬂ) and the Standards on Auditing as specified under section 143(10) of the Act, to the
 extent applicable to an audit of
internal financial controls, both applicable to an audit of Internal Financial Controls and, both is
sued by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requ
irements and plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over fin
ancial reporting was established
and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal
 financial controls system over
financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over
 financial reporting included obtaining
an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a 
material weakness exists, and testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk
. The procedures selected depend
on the auditor™s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the fi
nancial statements, whether due to
fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
 for our audit opinion on the
internal financial controls system over financial reporting.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting
A company™s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide rea
sonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
 in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company™s internal financial control over financial reporting includes thos
e policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary 
to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expend
itures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3
) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the com
pany™s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, includi
ng the possibility of collusion or improper
management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be d
etected. Also, projections of
any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are sub
ject to the risk that the internal financial
control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
 degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls s
ystem over financial reporting and
such internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as at March 31,
 2018, based on the internal control
over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of
 internal control stated in the
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institu
te of Chartered Accountants of
India.

2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:-
a)
Statement of compliance
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Ind AS notified under the Companies (
Indian Accounting
Standards) Rules, 2015 read with Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, as amended.
b)
Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis using historical cost convent
ion except for certain
financial instruments that are measured at fair values at the end of each reporting period, as expla
ined in the accounting
policies below. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in e
xchange for goods and
services.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in a
n orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable
 or estimated using
another valuation technique.
The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or tra
nsfer the liability takes
place either.
-
In the principal market for the asset or liabilities or
-
In the absence of a principal market in the most advantageous market for the asset and liabilities.
In estimating the fair value of an asset or liability, the Company takes into account the characteri
stics of the asset or liability
if market participants would take those characteristic into account when pricing the asset or liabil
ity at the measurement
date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these financial statements is determi
ned on such a basis,
except for share based payment transaction that are within the scope of Ind AS 102 
Share-based Payment
, leasing transactions
that are within the scope of Ind AS 17 
Leases
, and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair
valued such as net realizable value in Ind AS 2 or value in use in Ind AS 36 
Impairment of assets
.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements
 are categorized within the
fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to t
he fair value measurement as
a whole:
1)
Level 1 Š Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or Liabilities.
2)
Level 2 Š Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair valu
e measurement is
directly or indirectly observable.
3)

c)
Use of Estimates
The presentation of the financial statements are in conformity with the Ind AS which requires the ma
nagement to make
estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, rev
enues and expenses
and disclosure of contingent liabilities. Such estimates and assumptions are based on management™s e
valuation of relevant
facts and circumstances as on the date of financial statements. The actual outcome may differ from t
hese estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to the accounting e
stimates are
recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
d)
Inventories
Inventories are stated at lower of cost on weighted average basis and net realizable value after pro
viding for obsolescence
and other losses, where considered necessary. Cost includes cost of purchase and other expenses incu
rred in bringing the
inventories to their present location and condition. Cost includes all charges in bringing the goods
 to the point of sale,
including receiving charges, octroi and other levies and transit insurance. Work-in-progress and fin
ished goods include
appropriate proportion of overheads. Net realizable value represents the estimated selling price for
 inventories less all
estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale.

Cash and cash equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid financial instruments, which are readily convertible into kn
own amounts of cash
that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value and having original maturities of three
 months or less from the
date of purchase, to be cash equivalents.
f)
Revenue Recognition
Sale of goods
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of 
the goods have
passed to the buyer and no significant uncertainty exists regarding the amount of the consideration 
that will be derived
from the sale of goods. Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consider
ation received or
receivable, net of returns and allowances, related discounts & incentives and volume rebates. It inc
ludes excise duty and
excludes value added tax/ sales tax and goods and Service Tax (GST). Excise duty is a liability of t
he manufacturer which
forms part of the cost of production, irrespective of whether goods are sold or not. Since the recov
ery of the excise duty
flows to the company on its own account, revenue includes excise duty.
Interest Income
Interest income from financial assets is recognized when it is probable that the economic benefit wi
ll flow to the Group and
the amount of income can be measured reliably. Interest income is recorded using the effective inter
est rate (EIR). Interest
income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the interest rate a
pplicable, which is the
rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financia
l asset to that asset™s net
carrying amount on initial recognition.
g)
Property, plant and equipment
Property, Plant & Equipment are stated at actual cost less accumulated depreciation and net of impai
rment. The actual cost
capitalised includes material cost, freight, installation cost, duties and taxes and other incidenta
l expenses incurred during
the construction / installation stage.
Properties in the course of construction for production, supply or administration purposes are carri
ed at cost, less any
recognized impairment loss. All the direct expenditure related to implementation including incidenta
l expenditure incurred
during the period of implementation of a project, till it is commissioned, is accounted as Capital w
ork in progress (CWIP)
and such properties are classified to the appropriate categories of property, plant and equipment wh
en completed and
ready for intended use.
All items of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic 
benefits are expected
to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement
 of an item of property,
plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amou
nt of the asset and
is recognized in the statement of profit and loss.
Depreciation
Depreciable amount for assets is the cost of an asset, or other amount substituted for cost, less it
s estimated residual value.
Depreciation on Property, Plant and Equipment other than land and properties under construction are 
charged based on
straight line method on an estimated useful life as prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 
2013.
The estimated useful lives and residual values of the property, plant and equipment are reviewed at 
the end of each
reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.
Depreciation on items of property, plant and equipment acquired / disposed off during the year is pr
ovided on pro-rata
basis with reference to the date of addition / disposal.
h)
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately
Intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less acc
umulated amortization and
accumulated impairment losses. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over their estima
ted useful lives. The
estimated useful life are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any chang
es in estimate being
accounted for on a prospective basis.
Derecognition of intangible assets
An intangible asset is derecognized on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected fr
om use or disposal.
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset, measured as the difference betwee
n the net disposal
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, are recognized in the statement of profit and loss wh
en the asset is
derecognized.
Useful lives of intangible assets
Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life on a straight line basis over a per
iod of 5 years.

i)
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all t
he risks and rewards of
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Company as a lessee
Assets held under finance leases are initially recognized as an asset of the Company at their fair v
alue at the inception of
the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding liabil
ity to the lessor is
included in the balance sheet as the finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance expenses and reduction of the lease obligation so
 has to achieve the
constant rate of return on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance expenses are recognized i
mmediately in profit or
loss, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalized
 in accordance with the
Company™s general policy on borrowing costs.
Rental expense from operating lease is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the term o
f the relevant lease.
Where the rentals are structured solely to increase in line with expected general inflation to compe
nsate for the lessors
expected inflationary cost increase, such increases are recognized in the year in which such benefit
s accrue.
Company as a lessor
Rental income from operating leases is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the term o
f the relevant lease.
Where the rentals are structured solely to increase in line with expected general inflation to compe
nsate for the Company™s
expected inflationary cost increases, such increases are recognized in the year in which such benefi
ts accrue. Initial direct
cost incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of th
e leased asset and
recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term.
j)
Foreign Currencies
In preparing the financial statements of the Company, the transactions in currencies other than the 
entity™s functional currency
(INR) are recognized at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the en
d of each reporting
period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate prevailing at 
that date. Non-monetary
items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates p
revailing at the date when
fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a for
eign currency are not
retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on monetary items are recognized in the statement of profit and loss in
 the period in which
they arise.
k)
Employee Benefits
Employee benefits include provident fund, employee state insurance scheme, gratuity fund and compens
ated absences.
Defined Contribution Plan:
The Company™s contribution to Provident Fund is considered as defined contribution plans and are cha
rged as an expense
based on the amount of contribution required to be made and when services are rendered by the employ
ees.
Defined benefit plans:
For defined benefit plans in the form of gratuity fund, the cost of providing benefits is determined
 using the Projected Unit
Credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Remeasurement
, comprising actuarial
gains and losses, the effect of the changes to the return on plan assets (excluding net interest), i
s reflected immediately in
the balance sheet with a charge or credit recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in 
which they occur.
Remeasurement recognized in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in retained earnings
 and is not
reclassified to in the statement of profit and loss. Net interest is calculated by applying the disc
ount rate to the net defined
benefit liability or asset.
The Company recognizes the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation as an expense in 
the statement of
profit and loss:
1)
Service costs comprising past and current service costs, gains and losses on curtailments and settle
ments; and
2)
Net interest expense or income
The retirement benefit obligation recognized in the Balance Sheet represents the present value of th
e defined benefit
obligation as adjusted for unrecognized past service cost, as reduced by the fair value of scheme as
sets. Any asset resulting
from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds a
nd reductions in future
contributions to the schemes.
Short-term employee benefits:
The undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the serv
ices rendered by
NO

employees are recognized during the year when the employees render the service. These benefits inclu
de compensated
absences which are expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the e
mployee renders the
related service.
Long-term employee benefits:
Compensated absences which are not expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the perio
d in which the
employee renders the related service are recognized as a liability at the present value of the estim
ated future cash outflows
expected to be made by the Company in respect of services provided by employees up to the balance sh
eet date.
Share based payment:
Equity settled share based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instru
ments at the grant
date. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity settled share based payments is expe
nsed on a straight line
basis over the vesting period, based on the Company™s estimate of equity instruments that will event
ually vest, with a
corresponding increase in equity.
l)
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered princi
pally through a sale
transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the asse
t is available for
immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales
 of such assets and its
sale is highly probable. Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to quali
fy for recognition
as a completed sale within a year from the date of classification.
Non-current assets classified as held for sale are not depreciated and measured at the lower of thei
r carrying amount and
fair value less costs to sell.
m)
Borrowing costs
Borrowing cost includes interest, amortization of ancillary costs incurred in connection with the ar
rangement of borrowings
and exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent they are regarded as
 an adjustment to the
interest cost.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying a
ssets, which are assets
that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are
 added to the cost of those
assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Capitalization of borrowing cost is suspended and charged to statement of profit and loss during the
 extended period
when active development on the qualifying asset is interrupted.
All other borrowing costs are recognized in the statement of profit and loss in the period in which 
they are incurred.
n)
Earnings per share
A basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the profit/(loss) for the year attributable to eq
uity shareholders by the
weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is 
computed by dividing
the profit/(loss) for the year attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of
 equity shares considered
for deriving basic earnings per share and the weighted average number of equity shares which could h
ave been issued on
the conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.
Potential equity shares are deemed to be dilutive only if their conversion to equity shares would de
crease the net profit per
share from continuing ordinary operations. Potential dilutive equity shares are deemed to be convert
ed as at the beginning
of the period, unless they have been issued at a later date. The dilutive potential equity shares ar
e adjusted for the proceeds
receivable had the shares been actually issued at fair value (i.e. average market value of the outst
anding shares). Dilutive
potential equity shares are determined independently for each period presented.
o)
Taxation
Tax expense represents the sum of the current tax and deferred tax.
Current Tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Current tax is measured at the am
ount expected to be paid
to the tax authorities, based on estimated tax liability computed after taking credit for allowances
 and exemption in
accordance with the local tax laws. The Company™s current tax is calculated using tax rates that hav
e been enacted or
substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabi
lities in the financial
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax l
iabilities are generally
NO
TES FORMING P
AR
T
 OF 
THE S
T
AND
AL
ONE FINANCIAL
 ST
A
TEMENT
52
recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for a
ll deductible temporary
differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which t
hose deductible temporary
differences can be utilized. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognized if the temp
orary difference arises
from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax
able profit nor the accounting
profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduc
ed to the extent that
it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of t
he asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the 
period in which the liability
is settled or the asset realized, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substa
ntively enacted by the end
of the reporting period.
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would foll
ow from the manner in
which the Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amo
unt of its assets and
liabilities.
Deferred tax assets include Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) credit paid in accordance with the tax laws 
in India, which is likely
to give future economic benefits in the form of availability of set off against future income tax li
ability. Accordingly, MAT
credit is recognized as deferred tax asset in the Balance sheet when the asset can be measured relia
bly and it is probable
that the future economic benefit associated with the asset will be realised.
Current and deferred tax for the year
Current and deferred tax are recognized in the statement of profit and loss, except when they relate
 to items that are
recognized in other comprehensive income, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recog
nized in other
comprehensive income.
p)
Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets and Commitments
Provisions are recognized when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a res
ult of a past event, it
is probable that the Company will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can 
be made of the amount
of the obligation.
The amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle th
e present obligation at
the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obl
igations. When a provision
is measured using the cash flow estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is t
he present obligations of
those cash flows (when the effect of the time value of money is material).
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovere
d from a third party,
a receivable is recognized as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be receive
d and the amount of the
receivable can be measured reliably.
Contingent liabilities and Contingent assets are not recognized in the financial statements when an 
inflow/ outflow of
economic benefits/ loss are probable.
q)
Investments in subsidiaries and joint venture
Investments in subsidiaries and joint venture are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses
, if any. Where an
indication of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the investment is assessed and written down 
immediately to its
recoverable amount. On disposal of investments in subsidiaries and joint venture, the difference bet
ween net disposal
proceeds and the carrying amounts are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Investment in associate and joint venture are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equit
y method the investment
in an associate or joint venture is initially recognized at cost. The carrying amount of investment 
is adjusted to recognise
changes.
r)
Non-derivative Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when a Company becomes a party to the cont
ractual provisions of
the instruments. Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Tr
ansaction costs that are directly
attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than f
inancial assets and financial
liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value measu
red on initial recognition of
financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs
 directly attributable to the
acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are re
cognized immediately in the
statement of profit and loss.
Financial assets at amortised cost
Financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost if these financial assets are held with
in a business whose
objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual ter
ms of the financial asset

 ST
A

53
give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the
 principal amount
outstanding.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)
Financial assets are measured at fair value through profit and loss unless it is measured at amortis
ed cost or at fair value
through other comprehensive income on initial recognition. The transaction costs directly attributab
le to the acquisition of
financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are immediately recognised in 
statement of profit and loss.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is a contract that evidences residual interest in the assets of the Company aft
er deducting all of its
liabilities. Equity instruments recognised by the Company are measured at the proceeds received net 
off direct issue cost.
Offsetting of financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in financial st
atements if there is a currently
enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a ne
t basis, to realise the
assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
s)
Derivative financial instruments
The Company enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to inte
rest rate and foreign
exchange rate risks, including foreign exchange forward contracts/options and interest rate swaps.
The use of foreign currency forward contracts / options is governed by the Company™s policies approv
ed by the Board of
Directors, which provide written principles on the use of such financial derivatives consistent with
 the Company™s risk
management strategy. The counter party to the Company™s foreign currency forward contracts is genera
lly a bank. The
Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered 
into and are subsequently
remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is re
cognized in the statement
of profit and loss immediately.
Profit or loss arising on cancellation or renewal of a forward exchange contract is recognized as in
come or as expense in the
period in which such cancellation or renewal occurs.
t)
Impairment
Financial assets (other than at fair value)
The Company assesses at each Balance sheet whether a financial asset or a group of financial assets 
is impaired. Ind AS 109
requires expected credit losses to be measured through a loss allowance. The Company recognizes life
time expected
losses for all contract assets and/or all trade receivables that do not constitute a financing trans
action. For all other financial
assets, expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to the 12 month expected credit losse
s or at an amount
equal to the lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on the financial asset has increased
 significantly since initial
recognition.
Non-financial assets
Property, plant and Equipment and intangible assets
At the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and in
tangible assets to
determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any
 such indication exists,
the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment 
loss (if any). When it is
not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the re
coverable amount of
the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of alloc
ation can be identified,
corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash generating units, or otherwise they are alloc
ated to the smallest
group of cash generating unit for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identifi
ed.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing
 value in use, the estimated
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cas
h flows have not been
adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating unit) is estimated to be less than its car
rying amount, the carrying
amount of the asset (or cash generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment lo
ss is recognized
immediately in the statement profit and loss.

54
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or a cash generatin
g unit) is increased
to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does no
t exceed the carrying
amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset (or cash
 generating unit)
in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in the statement of profi
t and loss.
u)
Operating Cycle
The Company presents assets and liabilities in the balance sheet based on current / non-current clas
sification based on
operating cycle.
An asset is treated as current when it is:
1.
Expected to be realized or intended to be sold or consumed in normal operating cycle;
2.
Held primarily for the purpose of trading;
3.
Expected to be realized within twelve months after the reporting period, or
4.
Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at 
least twelve months
after the reporting period
All other assets are classified as non-current.
A liability is current when:
1.
It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle;
2.
It is held primarily for the purpose of trading;
3.
It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period, or
4.
There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months 
after the reporting
period
All other liabilities are classified as non-current.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.
v)
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with the Ind AS requires management to mak
e judgements,
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amount
s of assets, liabilities
and disclosures as at date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of the revenues and 
expenses for the years
presented. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other fac
tors that are
considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumption
s and conditions. The
estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estim
ates are recognized
in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the p
eriod of the revision and
future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The following are the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation unc
ertainty at the end of
the reporting period that may have a significant risk of causing as material adjustment to the carry
ing amounts of assets
and liabilities within next financial year.
i.
Useful lives of property, plant and equipment
As described in Note 2(g), the Company reviews the estimated useful lives and residual values of pro
perty, plant and
equipment at the end of each reporting period. During the current financial year, the management det
ermined that
there were no changes to the useful lives and residual values of the property, plant and equipment.
ii.
Allowances for doubtful debts
As described in Note 10, the Company makes allowances for doubtful debts based on an assessment of t
he recoverability
of trade and other receivables. The identification of doubtful debts requires use of judgement and e
stimates. Where
the expectation is different from the original estimate, such difference will impact the carrying va
lue of the trade and
other receivables and doubtful debts expenses in the period in which such estimate has been changed.
iii.
Fair value measurement of Financial Instruments
When the fair values of financials assets and financial liabilities recorded in the Balance Sheet ca
nnot be measured
based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques, i
ncluding the
discounted cash flow model, which involve various judgements and assumptions. Information about the 
fair value of
various assets and liabilities are disclosed in note 39.

The credit period ranges from 30 days to 180 days.

Before accepting any new customer, the Company assesses the potential customer™s credit quality and 
defines credit
limits by customer. Limits attributed to customers are reviewed annually. There are no customers who
 represent more than
5% of the total balance of trade receivable as at March 31, 2018 (as at March 31, 2017 : 
`
 2,027.61 lacs is due from one
customer who represents more than 5% of trade receivables.). The credit risk in respect of these cus
tomers is mitigated by
additional security cheque.
3
In determining the allowances for doubtful trade receivables, the Company has used a practical exped
ient by computing
the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables based on a provision matrix. The provision 
matrix takes into
account historical credit loss experience and is adjusted for forward looking information. The expec
ted credit loss allowance
is based on the ageing of the receivables that are due and rates used in the provision matrix.

Investment details of plan assets:
To fund the obligations under the gratuity plan, Contributions are made to Life Insurance Corporatio

The defined benefit obligations shall mature after year ended March 31, 2018 as follows:
(

(g)
Sensitivity analysis:
Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discou
nt rate, expected
salary increase and mortality. The sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on reasonab
ly possible
changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding al
l other
assumptions constant
(
` 
In Lacs)
The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defin
ed benefit
obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another 
as some of the
assumptions may be correlated.
Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation has
been calculated using ﬁProjected Unit Creditﬂ method at the end of the reporting period which is the
 same as that
applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in Balance Sheet.
There were no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from 
prior years.
The Company expects to make a contribution of 
` 
84.61 lacs (as at March 31, 2017 : 
` 
15.51 lacs) to the defined
benefit plans during the next financial year.
(h)
The principal assumptions used for the purpose of actuarial valuation were as follows :
Future Salary increases are based on long term average salary rise expected taking into account infl
ation, seniority,
promotion and other relevant factors such as supply and demand factors in the employee market. Futur
e Separation
& mortality rates are obtained from relevant data of Life Insurance Corporation of India.

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The Company is mainly exposed to the currency : USD,EUR and GBP.
The following table details,
Company™s sensitivity to a 5% increase and decrease in the rupee against the relevant
foreign currencies. 5% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally 
to key management
personnel and represents management™s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchan
ge
rates. This is mainly attributable to the exposure outstanding not hedged on receivables and payable
s in the
Company at the end of the reporting period. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding forei
gn currency
denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 5% change in foreig
n currency
rate. A positive number below indicates an increase in the profit and equity where the rupee strengt
hens 5%
against the relevant currency. For a 5% weakening of the rupee against the relevant currency, there 
would be a
comparable impact on the profit and equity, and the balances below would be negative.

The Company, in accordance with its risk management policies and procedures, enters into foreign cur

enerally a
bank. These contracts are for a period between one day and five years. The above sensitivity does no
t include the
impact of foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts which largely mitigate the risk.
ii
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flow with respect to interest payments on borrow
ing will fluctuate
because of change in market interest rates. The company™s exposure to the risk of changes in market 
interest rates
relates primarily to the Company™s long-term debt obligation with floating interest rates.
Interest rate sensitivity
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates o
n that portion
of loans and borrowings affected. With all other variables held constant, the Company™s profit befor

B
MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT RISK
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counter party will default on its contractual obligation resul
ting in financial loss to the
Company. The Company uses its own trading records to evaluate the credit worthiness of its customers
. The Company™s
exposure are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded, are spread am
ongst approved
counter parties (refer note 10 - Trade receivable).
The company is exposed to credit risk in relation to financial guarantees given to banks in respect 
of borrowings
obtained by the subsidiary company and joint venture. In case of joint Venture, the Company™s share 
is 50% and the
guarantee has been given jointly and severally by all the partners of Joint Venture. The Company™s m
aximum exposure
in this respect is of 
` 
7,044.62 lacs as at March 31, 2018, 
` 
6,562.27 lacs as at March 31, 2017 as disclosed in contingent
liabilities (Note 34).
C
MANAGEMENT OF LIQUIDITY RISK
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will face in meeting its obligations associated with its
 financial liabilities. The
Company™s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have suffici
ent liquidity to meet
its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unac
ceptable losses or
risking damage to the Company™s reputation.

OUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT
Standards issued but not yet effective
On March 28, 2018, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs issued the Companies (Indian Accounting Standar
ds) (Amendments)
Rules, 2018, notifying amendments to Ind AS 115, 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' and Ind AS 
12, 'Recognition of
Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealized Losses'. The amendments are applicable from April 1, 2018.
Ind AS 115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers:
Ind AS 115 was notified on March 28, 2018 and establishes a five-step model to account for revenue a
rising from contracts
with customers. Under Ind AS 115, revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration
 to which an entity
expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer.
The new revenue standard will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under Ind AS. T
his new standard
requires revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in am
ounts that reflect
the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or service
s. Adoption of the
new rules could affect the timing of revenue recognition for certain transactions of the Company. In
d AS 115 is effective for
the Company in the first quarter of financial year 2018-19 using either one of two methods:
i)
retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented in accordance with Ind AS 8 Accounting Poli
cies, Changes in
Accounting Estimates and Errors, with the option to elect certain practical expedients as defined wi
thin Ind AS 115 (the
full retrospective method); or
ii)
retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying Ind AS 115 recognized at the date o
f initial application
(April 1, 2018) and providing certain additional disclosures as defined in Ind AS 115 (the modified 
retrospective method).

Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receiv
able, net of returns and
allowances, related discounts & incentives and volume rebates given to customer and customers of the
 customers.
Amendments to Ind AS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses:
The amendments clarify that an entity needs to consider whether tax law restricts the sources of tax
able profits against which
it may make deductions on the reversal of that deductible temporary difference. Furthermore, the ame
ndments provide
guidance on how an entity should determine future taxable profits and explain the circumstances in w
hich taxable profit may
include the recovery of some assets for more than their carrying amount.
The effect of this amendment on the financial statements of the Company is being evaluated.

Events after the reporting period
The board of directors at its Meeting held on May 23, 2018 has recommended a dividend of Re. 0.35 pe

require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
 assurance about whether adequate
internal financial controls over financial reporting was established and maintained and if such cont
rols operated effectively in all material
respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal
 financial controls over financial
reporting with reference to the consolidated financial statements and their operating effectiveness.
 Our audit of internal financial controls
over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over fin
ancial reporting, assessing the risk that
a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of int
ernal control based on the assessed risk.
The procedures selected depend on the auditor™s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other aud
itors in terms of their reports referred
to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our au
dit opinion on the internal financial
controls over financial reporting with reference to these consolidated financial statements..
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting
A company™s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide rea
sonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
 in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company™s internal financial control over financial reporting includes thos
e policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to perm
it preparation of financial statements
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of t
he company are being made only in
accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonabl
e assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company™s assets that co
uld have a material effect on the financial
statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, includi
ng the possibility of collusion or improper
management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be d
etected. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject
 to the risk that the internal financial control
over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree 
of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Holding Company and its subsidiary companies which are companies incorporated in
 India, have, maintained in all
material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting and such 
internal financial controls over financial
reporting were operating effectively as at March 31, 2018, based on the internal control over financ
ial reporting criteria established by the
Holding Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note
 on Audit of Internal Financial
Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
Other Matters
Our report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the int
ernal financial controls over financial
reporting of the Holding Company, insofar as it relates to these two subsidiary companies which are 
companies incorporated in India, is
based on the corresponding reports of the auditors of such subsidiary companies incorporated in Indi
a.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in a
n orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or est
imated using another valuation
technique.
The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or tra
nsfer the liability takes place
either :
-
In the principal market for the asset or liabilities or
-
In the absence of a principal market in the most advantageous market for the asset and liabilities.
In estimating the fair value of an asset or liability, the Company takes into account the characteri
stics of the asset or liability if market
participants would take those characteristic into account when pricing the asset or liability at the
 measurement date. Fair value for
measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these financial statements is determined on such a basis, 
except for share based
payment transaction that are within the scope of Ind AS 102 
Share-based Payment
, leasing transactions that are within the scope of
Ind AS 17 
Leases
, and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair valued such as net rea
lizable value in
Ind AS 2 or value in use in Ind AS 36 
Impairment of assets
.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements
 are categorized within the fair value
hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair val
ue measurement as a whole:
1)
Level 1 Š Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
2)
Level 2 Š Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair valu
e measurement is directly or
indirectly observable.
3)
Level 3 Š Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair valu
e measurement is unobservable.
c)
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entiti
es controlled by the Company
and its subsidiaries. Control is achieved when the Company:
Ł
has power over the investee:
Ł
is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
Ł
has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
The company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate th
at there are changes to
one or more of the three elements of control listed above. When the Company has less than a majority
 of the voting rights of
an investee, it has power over the investee when the voting rights are sufficient to give it the pra
ctical ability to direct the relevant
activities of the investee unilaterally. The Company considers all relevant facts and circumstances 
in assessing whether or not
the Company™s voting rights in an investee are sufficient to give it power, including:
Ł
the size of the Company™s holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings o
f the other vote holders;

potential voting rights held by the Company, other vote holders or other parties;
Ł
rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and
Ł
any additional facts and circumstances when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceas
es when the Company
loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or dispo
sed of during the year are
included in the consolidated statement of profit and loss from the date the company gains control un
til the date when the
Company ceases to control the subsidiary.
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases
 when the Company loses
control of the subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of
 during the year are included
in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss from the date the Company gains control until the d
ate when the Company ceases
to control the subsidiary.
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the 
Company and to the non-
controlling interests. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the
 Company and to the non-
controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance
.
When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their acco
unting policies into line with
the Group™s accounting policies. The financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries have b
een combined on a line-by-
line basis by adding together the book values of like items of assets, liabilities, income and expen
ses, after eliminating intra-group
balances, intra-group transactions and the unrealised profits/losses, unless cost/revenue cannot be 
recovered. The excess of cost
to the Group of its investment in subsidiaries, on the acquisition dates over and above the Group™s 
share of equity in the
subsidiaries, is recognised as ‚Goodwill on Consolidation™ being an asset in the consolidated financ
ial statements. The said
Goodwill is not amortised, however, it is tested for impairment at each Balance Sheet date and the i
mpairment loss, if any, is
provided for. On the other hand, where the share of equity in subsidiaries as on the date of investm
ent is in excess of cost of
investments of the Group, it is recognised as ‚Capital Reserve™ and shown under the head ‚Reserves a
nd Surplus™ in the consolidated
financial statements.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries is identified and presented
 in the consolidated Balance
Sheet separately within equity.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries consists of:
(a)
The amount of equity attributable to non-controlling interests at the date on which investment in a 
subsidiary is made; and
(b)
The non-controlling interests share of movements in equity since the date parent subsidiary relation
ship came into existence.
d)
Investment in Joint Venture
A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangemen
t have rights to the net assets of
the joint arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangemen
t, which exists only when
decision about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
The results and assets and liabilities of joint venture are incorporated in these consolidated finan
cial statements using the equity
method of accounting, except when the investment or a portion thereof is classified as held for sale
, in which case it is accounted
for in accordance with Ind AS 105. Under equity method, an investment in a joint venture is initiall
y recognized in the consolidated
balance sheet at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the Group™s share of the profit and loss 
and other comprehensive
income of the joint venture. When the Group™s share of losses of a joint venture exceeds the Group™s
 interest in that joint venture
(which includes any long term interest that, in substance, form part of Group™s net investment in th
e joint venture), the Group
discontinues recognizing its share of further losses. Additional losses are recognized only to the e
xtent that the Group has incurred
legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.
An investment in a joint venture is accounted for using the equity method from the date on which the
 investee becomes a joint
venture. On acquisition of the investment in joint venture, any excess of cost of the investment ove
r the Group™s share of net fair value
of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee is recognized as goodwill, which is inclu
ded within the carrying amount of
the investment. Any excess of the Group™s share of net fair value of the identifiable assets and lia
bilities over the cost of the
investment, after reassessment, is recognized directly in equity as capital reserve in the period in
 which the investment is acquired.
After application of the equity method of accounting, the Group determines whether there any is obje
ctive evidence of impairment
as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the net investment 
in a joint venture and that event (or
events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows from the net investment that can be reliabl
y estimated. If there exists such
an objective evidence of impairment, then it is necessary to recognize impairment loss with respect 
to the Group™s investment in
a joint venture.
When necessary, the entire carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impa
irment in accordance with Ind
AS 36 Œ Impairment of assets as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value 
in use and fair value less costs
of disposables) with its carrying amount, any impairment loss recognized forms part of the carrying 
amount of the investment. Any
reversal of the impairment loss is recognized in accordance with Ind AS 36 to the extent that the re
coverable amount of the
investment subsequently increases.

When a Group entity transacts with a joint venture of the Group, profit and losses resulting from th
e transaction with the joint venture
are recognized in the Group™s consolidated financial statements only to the extent of interest in jo
int venture that are not related to
the Group.
The financial statements of the joint venture used in applying the equity method are prepared as of 
a date different from that used
by the entity, adjustments are made for the effects of significant transactions or events that occur
 between that date and the date of
the entity™s financial statements. The difference between the end of the reporting period of the joi
nt venture and that of the Company
is of three months. The length of the reporting periods and difference between the ends of the repor
ting periods are same from
period to period.
e)
Inventories
Inventories are stated at lower of cost on weighted average basis and net realizable value after pro
viding for obsolescence and
other losses, where considered necessary. Cost includes cost of purchase and other expenses incurred
 in bringing the inventories
to their present location and condition. Cost includes all charges in bringing the goods to the poin
t of sale, including receiving
charges, octroi and other levies and transit insurance. Work-in-progress and finished goods include 
appropriate proportion of
overheads. Net realizable value represents the estimated selling price for inventories less all esti
mated costs of completion and
costs necessary to make the sale.
f)
Cash and cash equivalents
The Group considers all highly liquid financial instruments, which are readily convertible into know
n amounts of cash that are
subject to an insignificant risk of change in value and having original maturities of three months o
r less from the date of purchase,
to be cash equivalents.
g)
Revenue Recognition
Sale of goods
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of 
the goods have passed to the
buyer and no significant uncertainty exists regarding the amount of the consideration that will be d
erived from the sale of goods.
Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receiv
able, net of returns and
allowances, related discounts & incentives and volume rebates. It includes excise duty and excludes 
value added tax/ sales tax and
goods and Service Tax (GST) based on the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. Excise duty is a 
liability of the manufacturer
which forms part of the cost of production, irrespective of whether goods are sold or not. Since the
 recovery of the excise duty flows
to the company on its own account, revenue includes excise duty.
Interest Income
Interest income from financial assets is recognized when it is probable that the economic benefit wi
ll flow to the Group and the
amount of income can be measured reliably. Interest income is recorded using the effective interest 
rate (EIR). Interest income is
accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the interest rate applicable,
 which is the rate that exactly
discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that as
set™s net carrying amount on initial
recognition.
h)
Property, plant and equipment
Property, Plant and Equipment are stated at actual cost less accumulated depreciation and of impairm
ent. The actual cost
capitalised includes material cost, freight, installation cost, duties and taxes and other incidenta
l expenses incurred during the
construction / installation stage.
Properties in the course of construction for production, supply or administration purposes are carri
ed at cost, less any recognized
impairment loss. All the direct expenditure related to implementation including incidental expenditu
re incurred during the period
of implementation of a project, till it is commissioned, is accounted as Capital work in progress (C
WIP) and such properties are
classified to the appropriate categories of property, plant and equipment when completed and ready f
or intended use.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic be
nefits are expected to
arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of
 an item of property, plant and
equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset and is recognized in
the consolidated statement of profit and loss.
Depreciation
Depreciable amount for assets is the cost of an asset, or other amount substituted for cost, less it
s estimated residual value.
Depreciation on Property, Plant and Equipment other than freehold land and properties under construc
tion are charged based on
straight line method on an estimated useful life as prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 
2013.
Depreciation on the tangible fixed assets of the Company™s foreign subsidiary has been provided on s
traight-line method as per
the estimated useful life of such assets as follows:

The estimated useful lives and residual values of the property, plant and equipment are reviewed at 
the end of each reporting
period, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.
Asset held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis a
s owned assets. However, when
there is no reasonable certainty that ownership will be obtained by the end of lease term, assets ar
e depreciated over the shorter
of the lease term and their useful lives.
Depreciation on items of property, plant and equipment acquired / disposed off during the year is pr
ovided on pro-rata basis with
reference to the date of addition / disposal.
i)
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately
Intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less acc
umulated amortization and
accumulated impairment losses. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over their estima
ted useful lives. The estimated
useful life is reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estim
ate being accounted for on a
prospective basis.
Derecognition of intangible assets
An intangible asset is derecognized on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected fr
om use or disposal. Gains
or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset, measured as the difference between the 
net disposal proceeds and the
carrying amount of the asset, are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit and loss when t
he asset is derecognized.
Useful lives of intangible assets
Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life on a straight line basis over a per
iod of 3 to 5 years.
j)
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all t
he risks and rewards of ownership
to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Group as a lessee
Assets held under finance leases are initially recognized as an asset of the Group at their fair val
ue at the inception of the lease or,
if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding liability to the les
sor is included in the consolidated
Balance Sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance expenses and reduction of the lease obligation so
 as to achieve the constant
rate of return on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance expenses are recognized immediatel
y in profit or loss, unless they
are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalized in accordance wit
h the Group™s general policy on
borrowing costs.
Rental expense from operating lease is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the term o
f the relevant lease. Where the
rentals are structured solely to increase in line with expected general inflation to compensate for 
the lessors expected inflationary
cost increase, such increases are recognized in the year in which such benefits accrue.
Group as a lessor
Rental income from operating leases is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the term o
f the relevant lease. Where the
rentals are structured solely to increase in line with expected general inflation to compensate for 
the Group™s expected inflationary
cost increases, such increases are recognized in the year in which such benefits accrue. Initial dir
ect cost incurred in negotiating
and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized
 on a straight line basis over
the lease term.
k)
Foreign Currencies
In preparing the consolidated financial statements of the Group, the transactions in currencies othe
r than the entity™s functional
currency (INR) are recognized at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. 
At the end of each reporting
period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate prevailing at 
that date. Non-monetary items
carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevail
ing at the date when fair value was
determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency a
re not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on monetary items are recognized in the statement of profit and loss in
 the period in which they arise.

Translation of Financial Statements of foreign entities
On Consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into INR at the ra
te of exchange prevailing at the
reporting date and their statements of Profit and Loss are translated at the average exchange rates 
for the period. On disposal of
foreign operation, the component of OCI relating to that particular operation is recognized in the S
tatement of Profit and Loss.
l)
Employee Benefits
Employee benefits include provident fund, employee state insurance scheme, gratuity fund and compens
ated absences.
Defined Contribution Plan:
The Group™s contribution to Provident Fund is considered as defined contribution plans and is charge
d as an expense based on the
amount of contribution required to be made and when services are rendered by the employees. The Pare
nt Company and its Indian
Subsidiaries operate defined contribution plans pertaining to ESIC and Provident fund scheme for eli
gible employees.
Defined benefit plans:
The Parent company and its Indian Subsidiaries operate a gratuity scheme for employees. The cost of 
providing benefits is
determined using the Projected Unit Credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at ea
ch balance sheet date.
Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the changes to the return on pla
n assets (excluding net
interest), is reflected immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit recognized in other
 comprehensive income in the
period in which they occur. Remeasurement recognized in other comprehensive income is reflected imme
diately in retained
earnings and is not reclassified to in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. Net interest i
s calculated by applying the
discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset.
The Group recognizes the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation as an expense in th
e consolidated statement of
profit and loss:
1)
Service costs comprising current service costs, gains and losses on curtailments and settlements; an
d
2)
Net interest expense or income
The retirement benefit obligation recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet represents the presen
t value of the defined benefit
obligation as adjusted for unrecognized past service cost, as reduced by the fair value of scheme as
sets. Any asset resulting from
this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and re
ductions in future contributions to
the schemes.
Short-term employee benefits:
The undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the serv
ices rendered by
employees are recognized during the year when the employees render the service. These benefits inclu
de compensated absences
which are expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employee r
enders the related service.
Long-term employee benefits:
Compensated absences which are not expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the perio
d in which the employee
renders the related service are recognized as a liability at the present value of the estimated futu
re cash outflows expected to be
made by the Group in respect of services provided by employees up to the balance sheet date. The Gro
up determines the liability
for such accumulated leaves using the Projected Unit Credit Method with actuarial valuations being c
arried out at each Balance
Sheet date.
Share based payment:
Equity settled share based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instru
ments at the grant date. The fair
value determined at the grant date of the equity settled share based payments is expensed on a strai
ght line basis over the vesting
period, based on the Group™s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with a corres
ponding increase in equity.
m)
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered princi
pally through a sale transaction
rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the asset is availab
le for immediate sale in its
present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets and it
s sale is highly probable.
Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a c
ompleted sale within a year
from the date of classification.
Non-current assets classified as held for sale are not depreciated and measured at the lower of thei
r carrying amount and fair value
less costs to sell.
n)
Borrowing costs
Borrowing cost includes interest, amortization of ancillary costs incurred in connection with the ar
rangement of borrowings and
exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent they are regarded as an 
adjustment to the interest
cost.

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying a
ssets, which are assets that
necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are adde
d to the cost of those assets, until
such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Capitalization of borrowing cost is suspended and charged to statement of Profit and loss during the
 extended period when active
development of the qualifying asset is interrupted.
All other borrowing costs are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit and loss in the per
iod in which they are incurred.
o)
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the profit/(loss) for the year attributable to equi
ty shareholders by the weighted
average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is computed 
by dividing the profit/(loss)
for the year attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares con
sidered for deriving basic
earnings per share and the weighted average number of equity shares which could have been issued on 
the conversion of all
dilutive potential equity shares.
Potential equity shares are deemed to be dilutive only if their conversion to equity shares would de
crease the net profit per share
from continuing ordinary operations. Potential dilutive equity shares are deemed to be converted as 
at the beginning of the period,
unless they have been issued at a later date. The dilutive potential equity shares are adjusted for 
the proceeds receivable had the
shares been actually issued at fair value (i.e. average market value of the outstanding shares). Dil
utive potential equity shares are
determined independently for each period presented.
p)
Taxation
Tax expense represents the sum of the current tax and deferred tax.
Current Tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Current tax is measured at the am
ount expected to be paid to the
tax authorities, based on estimated tax liability computed after taking credit for allowances and ex
emption in accordance with the
local tax laws existing in the respective countries. The Group™s current tax is calculated using tax
 rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabi
lities in the financial
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax l
iabilities are generally
recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for a
ll deductible temporary
differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which t
hose deductible temporary
differences can be utilized. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognized if the temp
orary difference arises from the
initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable prof
it nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduc
ed to the extent that it is no
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset 
to be recovered.
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the 
period in which the liability is settled
or the asset realized, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively ena
cted by the end of the reporting
period.
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would foll
ow from the manner in which
the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of i
ts assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets include Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) credit paid in accordance with the tax laws 
in India, which is likely to give
future economic benefits in the form of availability of set off against future income tax liability.
 Accordingly, MAT credit is
recognized as deferred tax asset in the Consolidated Balance sheet when the asset can be measured re
liably and it is probable that
the future economic benefit associated with the asset will be realised.
The deferred tax assets (net) and deferred tax liabilities (net) are determined separately for the P
arent and each subsidiary company
as per their applicable laws and then aggregated.
MAT credit is recognized as an asset only when and to the extent there is convincing evidence that t
he respective Group Company
will pay normal tax during the specified period. Such asset is reviewed at each Balance sheet date a
nd the carrying amount of the
MAT credit asset is written down to the extent there is no longer a convincing evidence to the effec
t that the company will pay
normal tax during the specified period.
Current and deferred tax for the year
Current and deferred tax are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit and loss, except whe
n they relate to items that are
recognized in other comprehensive income, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recog
nized in other comprehensive
income.

The Group offsets current tax assets and current tax liabilities, where it has a legally enforceable
 right to set off the recognized
amounts and where it intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the
 liability simultaneously. In case of
deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, the same are offset if the Group has a legally enf
orceable right to set off corresponding
current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liab
ilities relate to income taxes levied
by the same tax authority on the Group.
q)
Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets and Commitments
Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a resul
t of a past event, it is probable
that the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the
 amount of the obligation.
The amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle th
e present obligation at the end
of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligations
. When a provision is measured
using the cash flow estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present o
bligations of those cash flows
(when the effect of the time value of money is material).
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovere
d from a third party, a
receivable is recognized as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received 
and the amount of the receivable
can be measured reliably.
Contingent liabilities and Contingent assets are not recognized in the consolidated financial statem
ents when an inflow/ outflow of
economic benefits/ loss are probable.
r)
Non-derivative Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when a Group becomes a party to the contra
ctual provisions of the
instruments. Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transa
ction costs that are directly attributable
to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial asse
ts and financial liabilities at fair value
through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value measured on initial recognition
 of financial assets or financial
liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition of financial assets or
financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognized immediately in the consoli
dated statement of profit and loss.
Financial assets at amortized cost
Financial assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost if these financial assets are held with
in a business whose objective
is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the 
financial asset give rise on
specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal am
ount outstanding.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)
Financial assets are measured at fair value through profit and loss unless it is measured at amortiz
ed cost or at fair value through
other comprehensive income on initial recognition. The transaction costs directly attributable to th
e acquisition of financial assets
and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are immediately recognized in consolidated stat
ement of profit and loss.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is a contract that evidences residual interest in the assets of the Group after
 deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments recognized by the Group are measured at the proceeds received net off direct issu
e cost.
Offsetting of financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in financial st
atements if there is a currently
enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a ne
t basis, to realize the assets and
settle the liabilities simultaneously.
s)
Derivative financial instruments
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to intere
st rate and foreign exchange rate
risks, including foreign exchange forward contracts/options and interest rate swaps.
The use of foreign currency forward contracts / options is governed by the Group™s policies approved
 by the Board of Directors,
which provide written principles on the use of such financial derivatives consistent with the Group™
s risk management strategy. The
counter party to the Group™s foreign currency forward contracts is generally a bank. The Group does 
not use derivative financial
instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered 
into and are subsequently remeasured
to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognized in
 the consolidated statement of profit
and loss immediately.

Impairment
Financial assets (other than at fair value)
The Group assesses at each Balance sheet whether a financial asset or a Group of financial assets is
 impaired. Ind AS 109 requires
expected credit losses to be measured through a loss allowance. The Group recognizes lifetime expect
ed losses for all contract
assets and/or all trade receivables that do not constitute a financing transaction. For all other fi
nancial assets, expected credit
losses are measured at an amount equal to the 12 month expected credit losses or at an amount equal 
to the lifetime expected
credit losses if the credit risk on the financial asset has increased significantly since initial re
cognition.
Non-financial assets
Property, Plant and Equipment and intangible assets
At the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and inta
ngible assets to determine
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indi
cation exists, the recoverable
amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). W
hen it is not possible to estimate
the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cas
h generating unit to which
the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate
 assets are also allocated to
individual cash generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest Group of cash gene
rating unit for which a
reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing
 value in use, the estimated future
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current
 market assessments of the time
value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have
 not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating unit) is estimated to be less than its car
rying amount, the carrying amount
of the asset (or cash generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is r
ecognized immediately in the
consolidated statement profit and loss.
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or a cash generatin
g unit) is increased to the
revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not excee
d the carrying amount that
would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset (or cash generating 
unit) in prior years. A
reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of profit and
 loss.
u)
Operating Cycle
The Group presents assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet based on current / non-c
urrent classification based on
operating cycle.
An asset is treated as current when it is:
1.
Expected to be realized or intended to be sold or consumed in normal operating cycle;
2.
Held primarily for the purpose of trading;
3.
Expected to be realized within twelve months after the reporting period, or
4.
Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at 
least twelve months after the
reporting period
All other assets are classified as non-current.
A liability is current when:
1.
It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle;
2.
It is held primarily for the purpose of trading;
3.
It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period, or
4.
There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months 
after the reporting period
All other liabilities are classified as non-current.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.
The Group has identified twelve months as its operating cycle.

Segment Reporting
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which discrete financial informati
on is available that is
evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, in deciding how to allocate resources and
 assessing performance. The
Group™s chief operating decision maker is the Managing Director.
Segment revenue, segment expenses, segment assets and segment liabilities have been identified to se
gments on the basis of their
relationship to the operating activities of the segment. Inter segment revenue is accounted on the b
asis of transactions which are
primarily determined based on market / fair value factors. Revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities
 which relate to the Group as
a whole and are not allocable to segments on a reasonable basis have been included under ﬁunallocate
d revenue / expenses /
assets / liabilitiesﬂ.
w)
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with the Ind AS requires mana
gement to make judgements,
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amount
s of assets, liabilities and
disclosures as at date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of the reve
nues and expenses for the years
presented. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other fac
tors that are considered to
be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditio
ns. The estimates and underlying
assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in th
e period in which the
estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and f
uture periods if the revision affects
both current and future periods.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The following are the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation unc
ertainty at the end of the
reporting period that may have a significant risk of causing as material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities
within next financial year.
i.
Useful lives of property, plant and equipment
As described in Note 2(h), the Group reviews the estimated useful lives and residual values of prope
rty, plant and equipment
at the end of each reporting period. During the current financial year, the management determined th
at there were no changes
to the useful lives and residual values of the property, plant and equipment.
ii.
Provisions and Contingent Liabilities
Provisions and Contingent Liabilities are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and adjusted to reflec
t the current best
estimates.
iii.
Allowances for doubtful debts
As described in Note 12, the Group makes allowances for doubtful debts based on an assessment of the
 recoverability of
trade and other receivables. The identification of doubtful debts requires use of judgement and esti
mates. Where the
expectation is different from the original estimate, such difference will impact the carrying value 
of the trade and other
receivables and doubtful debts expenses in the period in which such estimate has been changed.
iv.
Fair value measurement of Financial Instruments
When the fair values of financials assets and financial liabilities recorded in the Consolidated Bal
ance Sheet cannot be
measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation tech
niques, including the
discounted cash flow model, which involve various judgements and assumptions. Information about the 
fair value of various
assets and liabilities are disclosed in Note 43.
v.
Impairment of Goodwill
Cash generating units to which goodwill is allocated are tested for impairment annually at each bala
nce sheet date, or more
frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of t
he cash generating unit is
less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carr
ying amount of any goodwill
allocated to that unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of carrying am
ount of each asset in the unit.

customer. Limits attributed to customers are reviewed periodically. There are no customers who repre
sent more than 5% of the
total balance of trade receivable as at March 31, 2018 (as at March 31, 2017 : 
` 
2,027.61 lacs is due from one customer who
represents more than 5% of trade receivables.). The credit risk in respect of these customers is mit
igated by additional security
cheque.

In determining the allowances for doubtful trade receivables, the Group has used a practical expedie
nt by computing the
expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables based on a provision matrix. The provision matr
ix takes into account
historical credit loss experience and is adjusted for forward looking information. The expected cred
it loss allowance is based
on the ageing of the receivables that are due and rates used in the provision matrix.

Sensitivity analysis:
Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discou
nt rate, expected salary
increase and mortality. The sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on reasonably poss
ible changes of the
respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumpt
ions constant.
(
`
 In Lacs)
The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defin
ed benefit obligation as
it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the
 assumptions may be
correlated.
Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation has been
calculated using ﬁProjected Unit Creditﬂ method at the end of the reporting period which is the same
 as that applied in
calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in Balance Sheet.

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The Group is mainly exposed to the currency : USD, EUR and SGD.
The following table details,  Group™s sensitivity to a 5% increase and decrease in the rupee against
 the relevant
foreign currencies. 5% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally 
to key management
personnel and represents management™s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchan
ge rates.
This is mainly attributable to the exposure outstanding not hedged on receivables and payables in th
e Group at the
end of the reporting period. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency den
ominated
monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 5% change in foreign currency r
ate. A positive
number below indicates an increase in the profit and equity where the rupee strengthens 5% against t
he relevant
currency. For a 5% weakening of the rupee against the relevant currency, there would be a comparable
 impact on
the profit and equity, and the balances below would be negative.

The Group, in accordance with its risk management policies and procedures, enters into foreign curre
ncy forward
contracts to manage its exposure in foreign exchange rate variations. The counter party is generally
 a bank. These
contracts are for a period between one day and five years. The above sensitivity dose not include th
e impact of
foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts which largely mitigate the risk.
ii
Interest risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flow with respect to interest payments on borrow
ing will fluctuate
because of change in market interest rates. The group™s exposure to the risk of changes in market in
terest rates
relates primarily to the Group™s long-term debt obligation with floating interest rates.
Interest rate sensitivity
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates o
n that portion of
loans and borrowings affected. With all other variables held constant, the Group™s profit before tax
 is affected
through the impact on floating rate borrowings, as follows:

The assumed movement in basis points for the interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on the curr
ently observable
market environment, showing a significantly higher volatility than in prior years.
B
MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT RISK
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counter party will default on its contractual obligation resul
ting in financial loss to the
Group. The Group uses its own trading records to evaluate the credit worthiness of its customers. Th
e Group™s exposure
are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded, are spread amongst app
roved counter
parties (Refer note 12 - Trade receivable).
The Parent company is exposed to credit risk in relation to financial guarantees given to banks in r
espect of borrowings
obtained by the joint venture. In case of joint Venture, the Parent Company™s share is 50.00% and th
e guarantee has been
given jointly and severally by all the partners of Joint Venture.
The Parent Company™s maximum exposure in this respect is of 
`
 4,746.73 lacs as at March 31, 2018 and 
`
 4,770.51 lacs
as at March 31, 2017 as disclosed in contingent liabilities (Refer Note 35).
C
MANAGEMENT OF LIQUIDITY RISK
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will face in meeting its obligations associated with its f
inancial liabilities. The
Group™s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficien
t liquidity to meet its
liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unaccept
able losses or
risking damage to the Group™s reputation.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has e
stablished an appropriate
liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Group™s short-term, medium-term and lo
ng-term
funding and liquidity management requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequ
ate reserves,
banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual 
cash flows, and by
matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The following table shows the maturity analysis of the Group™s financial liabilities based on contra
ctually agreed
undiscounted cash flows along with its carrying value as at the Balance Sheet date.

Recent accounting pronouncement
Standards issued but not yet effective
On March 28, 2018, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs issued the Companies (Indian Accounting Standar
ds) (Amendments) Rules,
2018, notifiying amendments to Ind AS 115, ‚Revenue from Contracts with Customers™ and Ind AS 12, ‚R
ecognition of Deferred Tax
Assets for Unrealized Losses™. The amendments are applicable from April 1, 2018.
Ind AS 115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers:
Ind AS 115 was notified on March 28, 2018 and establishes a five-step model to account for revenue a
rising from contracts with
customers. Under Ind AS 115, revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to w
hich an entity expects to be
entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer.
The new revenue standard will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under Ind AS. T
his new standard requires
revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in amounts tha
t reflect the consideration
to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Adoption of the
 new rules could affect the
timing of revenue recognition for certain transactions of the Company. Ind AS 115 is effective for t
he Company in the first quarter of
financial year 2018-19 using either one of two methods:
i)
retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented in accordance with Ind AS 8 Accounting Poli
cies, Changes in
Accounting Estimates and Errors, with the option to elect certain practical expedients as defined wi
thin Ind AS 115 (the full
retrospective method); or
ii)
retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying Ind AS 115 recognized at the date o
f initial application (1 April
2018) and providing certain additional disclosures as defined in Ind AS 115 (the modified retrospect
ive method).
Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receiv
able, net of returns and
allowances, related discounts & incentives and volume rebates given to customer and customers of the
 customers.
Amendments to Ind AS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses:
The amendments clarify that an entity needs to consider whether tax law restricts the sources of tax
able profits against which it may
make deductions on the reversal of that deductible temporary difference. Furthermore, the amendments
 provide guidance on how
an entity should determine future taxable profits and explain the circumstances in which taxable pro
fit may include the recovery of
some assets for more than their carrying amount.
The effect of this amendment on the financial statements of the Company is being evaluated.
