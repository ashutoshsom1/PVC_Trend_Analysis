WITHOUT A 
CHANCE, THERE™S 

LITTLE PASSION 

CAN DO.
Without the drive to succeed,
 
opportunities often lay wasted. It™s when 
the passion to achieve meets the right 
opportunities that success becomes 
inevitable. And this succinctly describes 

the year we™ve had at Astral.
Challenges were effectively resolved, expansions 
and innovations were made, excellent results were 

achieved, and our position in the industry was 

strengthened. All because, our inherent driven 

philosophy and passion for our work met the 

opportunities that helped bring in the performances 

we can be 
proud of. And thereby led us to create 
maximum value for each and everyone invested in 

Astral!

MANAGING DIRECTOR™S 
MESSAGE
Dear Shareholders, 
Astral delivered another strong topline 
and bottom line growth during the 
current ˜scal validating our position 
as one of the most reputed players in 
the piping industry. The performance 
re˚ects our ability to overcome the 
macroeconomic challenges prevalent 
in the industry with a strategic and 
sustainable business model in place. 
A diversi˜ed portfolio, state-of-the-art 
technologies and strong distribution 
presence across the country are some 
of the key components of our business 
model that add to our competitiveness.
Looking back at the year, there were 
some headwinds that we faced, 
particularly in our piping segment. One, 
the logistics strike nationwide for about 
10-15 days did impact our business in 
terms of sales and volumes. Two, the 
fall in prices of PVC pipes hampered 
the sales and overall margin growth of 
the segment. In addition to this, price 
revision in CPVC on account of currency 
volatility also further impacted the 
overall margins. However, we managed 
to mitigate these volatile and temporary 
factors with new product launches, and 
additional production capacities in 
North India, transcending into a healthy 
˜nancial performance.
Our consolidated revenue during 
the year increased by 21% reaching 
 
H
25,073 mn in FY19 from 
H
20,729 mn 

in FY18. The piping segment recorded 
a revenue growth of 21.1 % with sales 
volume growing by 18.27% YoY. The 
consolidated EBITDA Margin stood at 
15.83% & PAT Margin stood at 7.87% 
during the year under review.
During the year, we also undertook 
several initiatives, such as introduction 
of  Pex-a Pro, an advanced, next 
generation plumbing product for hot 

and cold water plumbing, which was 
launched in H2 FY19. While the product 
was well accepted in the market, 
we completed ˜ve major projects 
for our new product line (Pex-a Pro) 
during the year. In the pipe segment, 

we commenced the production at 
newly constructed plant at Ghiloth, 
Rajasthan while the additional capacity 
at Hosur, Tamil Nadu is on the verge of 
completion. These capacities complete 
our presence in West, South and North 
India - one of the very few companies in 
our industry to do so. Further, we are on 
track to begin construction of another 
green˜eld facility in Odisha, where we 
have already acquired land of 100K Sq. 
yards. This will help us save on logistic 
costs and strengthen our market share 
in Eastern India.
In our Adhesive & Sealant business, we 
have delivered a robust consolidated 

growth of 20.6% in revenue and EBIDTA 
margin of 13.50%. While the margin 
I HAVE CONFIDENCE 
THAT ASTRAL 

WILL CONTINUE 

ITS JOURNEY 
TOWARDS SUCCESS, 
CREATING FURTHER 
SHAREHOLDER 
VALUE THROUGH 

PROFITABLE AND 

RESPONSIBLE 

GROWTH.

MESSAGE FROM CFO
Dear Shareholders, 
Last year was full of challenges & 
activities in the company. Market was 
highly volatile in terms of demand on 
month-on-month basis, the currency 
heavily depreciated & then again 
appreciated. In addition, the polymer 
prices were too highly ˚uctuating. In 
spite of all these challenges ASTRAL 
stood up to the expectation of Investors.
We successfully implemented SAP in 
our newly acquired business Œ REX 

POLYEXTRUSION PVT. LTD. This newly 
acquired entity is now merged with 
ASTRAL and all MIS reports are under 
was little lower than previous year 
on account of aggressive spends on 
branding of new products, we are very 
optimistic about this segment going 

forward and expect it to deliver healthy 
returns in the coming years.
We are happy to inform that the 
acquisition of infrastructure product 
company (Rex Polyextrusion Pvt. 
Ltd.) was successfully completed and 
subsequently it was merged with Astral 

and now forms an integral part of the 
our business. The acquisition not only 
diversi˜es our product pro˜le but 
integrates well into our future growth 
strategy to create value for stakeholders.
As I look forward, I have con˜dence that 

Astral will continue its journey towards 
success, creating further shareholder 
value through pro˜table and 

responsible growth. Drawing inspiration 
from our legacy and heritage, we will 
continue to demonstrate our passion 
and effectiveness to outperform 
industry growth and turn challenges into 
opportunities. We have always remained 
committed to growth with new product 
launches and capacity additions that 
help us sustain growth and deliver 
returns. We have also made signi˜cant 
progress with the implementation of our 
strategic priorities and expanded our 
mid- to long-term ˜nancial ambitions for 
our company.
Finally, I would like to express my 
gratitude to our shareholders, 
customers, bankers and vendors for 
their trust and continued support in 
our company. I would like to thank 
our Board, management team and 
the employees for their hard work and 
support.
Regards,

Sandeep Engineer
Managing Director
control of ASTRAL management 

team. We are expecting reasonable 
improvement post this implementation 
& EBIDTA margin will expand rapidly in 
coming quarters.
As communicated in our earlier investor 
communications, we are committed to 
focus on our working capital cycle. As 
a part of that journey we have already 
started correction in receivable days 
which you can see in the numbers that 
we have reduced the days from 51 to 43 
days on standalone basis & from 54 to 
49 days in consolidation. We have taken 
this dif˜cult task at a time when a lot of 
challenges of liquidity are present in 
the market. Not only that, the position 

of PSU banks are not good but yet, 
keeping in mind our long term goal, we 
have taken up this task and we are quite 
con˜dent that we will see good days 
going forward with these corrections.
Going forward, we will focus more on 
our capacity utilisation which is very low 
at present. We have done large-scale 
capex in last three years with a goal to 

create capacity at regional level. We 
expanded capacity in Southern and 
Northern India last year and plan to 
do the same in Eastern India this year. 
Once that is done, capacity utilisation 
will improve signi˜cantly and will give 
sizeable improvement into ROC. Also 
the company will be able to gain market 
share in respective regions where we 
have recently added the capacity by 
saving considerably on logistic costs.
Last but not least, the path to growth 
would be full of challenges, but we at 
ASTRAL are committed to face them 
and to remain on growth trajectory with 
reasonable pace on a sustainable basis 

for the best interest of the stake holders, 
keeping focus on the most effective way 
of capital utilisation in mind.
Regards,
Hiranand Savlani

Indian Industry Overview
The pipe industry in India had witnessed a robust growth and 
has reached at an estimated value of 
H
 280 billion by the end of 
FY 2018. This growth resulted due to high growth in the building 

and construction sector, automobile industry and growing 
medical hospitals. The CVPC pipe in India had been growing 
at a faster rate than the existing plastic pipe system. In order to 
encourage the sector, the Government of India (GOI) has been 
placing orders for sewage, water supplies and plumbing pipes. 
Continuous increase in allocation of irrigation and housing by 
Government of India is going to give momentum to the piping 
industry. With rapid growth in population, there has been an 
increase in demand of residential applications of pipes also.
In recent time, there has been a drastic shift of demand from 
metal to polymer based pipes, especially in plumbing and 
piping application in the construction industry. This has led to 
increase in usage of plastic pipes and emergence of CPVC pipes 
for hot and cold water plumbing, ˜re˜ghting. The production of 
CPVC piping industry requires huge investment in technology 
and expertise making it dif˜cult for players to enter into this 
segment. As a result, this provides huge opportunities to the 
existing players to increase their market share and revenue in 
replacement as well as new construction. 
Going forward, the industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 
14% between FY 2018-2022. The growth will be on account 
of various government initiatives and growth in downstream 
industries including Infrastructure, plumbing, irrigation and 

telecom. 
Government Initiatives
Various government initiatives in the downstream industries 
which are helping and contributing towards growth of piping 
industry are illustrated below: 
Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana- Housing for All (Urban)

This scheme is an initiative by GOI with an aim to provide 
affordable housing to urban poor people. It aims to build 20 
million affordable housing by 31
st
 march 2020. This scheme is 
implemented across 4,041 statutory towns with the initial focus 
on 500 Class I cities in India. 
Smart Cities Mission

An urban renewal and retro˜tting program by GoI with an 
aim of building 100 smart cities across the country. The core 
infrastructural requirement to develop Smart cities can be 
achieved with Smart solutions like E-Governance and Citizen 
Services, Energy Management, Waste Management, Urban 
Mobility, Water Management etc. The strategic components 
of area-based development in the Smart Cities Mission are 
city improvement (Retro˜tting), city renewal (Redevelopment) 

and city extension (Green˜eld development) plus a Pan-city 
initiative in which Smart Solutions are applied covering larger 
parts of the city.

has access to a tap with a proper supply of water connections, 
construction of buildings etc. The essential components 
associated with this scheme are water supply, sewerage and 
storm water drainage etc.
National Rural Drinking Water Programme

The main objective of this scheme is to provide rural people 
adequate safe water for drinking, cooking and ensure that all 
the sections of the communities have access to safe drinking 

water. This scheme seeks to prevent the contamination of water. 
Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY)

with assured irrigation, reduce wastage of water and improve 

water use ef˜ciency. The initiative not only on creating sources 
for assured irrigation, but also creating protective irrigation by 
harnessing rain water. 
Growth Drivers

Ł
 
Features:
 The growth in demand of plastic pipes, 
especially CPVC, have been growing due to their distinct 
features such as quality, high durability and affordability. 
Ł
 
Real-estate:
 With increase in demand for housing fuelled 
by various government initiatives and rise in per capita 
income has led to increase in demand for quality pipes. 
Ł
 
Infrastructure:
 The Government of India is focusing on 
rural and sanitation infrastructure, which will increase the 
demand for plastic pipes. With the development of ‚smart 
cities™ in India, CPVC consumption will increase due to a 
huge requirement of urban infrastructure in these cities.
Ł
 
Housing:
 The demand for housing in the middle income 
group is massive in India. With a view to bridge the gap of 
supply, the government has been initiating measures by 
bringing in the concept of green building. With the given 
nature of CPVC pipes, their demand is expected to grow 

for the housing segment. 
Ł
 
Irrigation:
 Government has been undertaken various 
initiative, such as Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana 

(PMKSY), to insure proper irrigation facility. As a result, this 

is expected to augment the demand of PVC pipes as they 
are most suitable for irrigation purpose.

The Company™s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the 
preparation of these standalone Ind AS ˜nancial statements 
that give a true and fair view of the ˜nancial position, ˜nancial 
performance including other comprehensive income, cash

with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, 
including the Indian Accounting  Standards (Ind AS) speci˜ed

(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. 
This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the 
Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for 
preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities;

intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or 
has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing 
the Company™s ˜nancial reporting process.

Auditor™s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
standalone Ind AS Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the standalone Ind AS ˜nancial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor™s report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to in˚uence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone Ind 
AS ˜nancial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
Ł
 
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of 
the standalone Ind AS ˜nancial statements, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that 
is suf˜cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 

omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal 
control. 
Ł
 
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal 
˜nancial controls system in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls.
Ł
 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 

and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by management. 
Ł
 
Conclude on the appropriateness of management™s use of 
the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the 
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty 
exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
signi˜cant doubt on the Company™s ability to continue as 
a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor™s 
report to the related disclosures in the ˜nancial statements 
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our 
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our auditor™s report. However, 
future events or conditions may cause the Company to 
cease to continue as a going concern. 
Ł
 
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of 
the standalone Ind AS ˜nancial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the standalone Ind AS ˜nancial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 
We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and signi˜cant audit ˜ndings, including 
any signi˜cant de˜ciencies in internal control that we identify 
during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a 
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and 
where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
signi˜cance in the audit of the standalone Ind AS ˜nancial 
statements for the ˜nancial year ended March 31, 2019 and 
are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters 
in our auditor™s report unless law or regulation precludes 

public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely 
rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should 
not be communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to 
outweigh the public interest bene˜ts of such communication.
Other Matter

We did not audit the ˜nancial statements and other ˜nancial 
information of Amalgamating Company, which was merged 
into the Company with effect from July 10, 2018, included in

Annexure 2 to the Independent Auditor™s Report of Even Date on the Ind AS Financial Statements of 
Astral Poly Technik Limited
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under 
Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the 

Companies Act, 2013 (ﬁthe Actﬂ)
We have audited the internal ˜nancial controls over ˜nancial 
reporting of Astral Poly Technik Limited (ﬁthe Companyﬂ) as of 
March 31, 2019 in conjunction with our audit of the Standalone 
Ind AS ˜nancial statements of the Company for the year ended 
on that date.
Management™s Responsibility for Internal 
Financial Controls
The Company™s Management is responsible for establishing 
and maintaining internal ˜nancial controls based on the 
internal control over ˜nancial reporting criteria established 
by the Company considering the essential components of 
internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of 

Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. These 
responsibilities include the design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal ˜nancial controls that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and ef˜cient 
conduct of its business, including adherence to the Company™s 
policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and 
detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness 

of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of 
reliable ˜nancial information, as required under the Companies 
Act, 2013. 
Auditor™s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company™s 

internal ˜nancial controls over ˜nancial reporting with 
reference to these Standalone Ind AS ˜nancial statements 
based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance 
with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting (the ﬁGuidance Noteﬂ) and the 
Standards on Auditing as speci˜ed under section 143(10) 
of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an 
audit of internal ˜nancial controls and, both issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. Those Standards 
and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical 
requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal 
˜nancial controls over ˜nancial reporting with reference to 
these Standalone Ind AS ˜nancial statements was established 
and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all 
material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal ˜nancial controls 
over ˜nancial reporting with reference to these Standalone 
Ind AS ˜nancial statements and their operating effectiveness. 
Our audit of internal ˜nancial controls over ˜nancial reporting 
included obtaining an understanding of internal ˜nancial 
controls over ˜nancial reporting with reference to these 
Standalone Ind AS ˜nancial statements, assessing the risk that 
a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the 
design and operating effectiveness of internal control based 
on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the 
auditor™s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the ˜nancial statements, whether due 
to fraud or error. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
suf˜cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the internal ˜nancial controls over ˜nancial 
reporting with reference to these Standalone Ind AS ˜nancial 
statements
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting With Reference to these Ind 

AS Financial Statements
A company™s internal ˜nancial control over ˜nancial 
reporting with reference to these Standalone Ind AS ˜nancial 
statements is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of ˜nancial reporting 
and the preparation of ˜nancial statements for external 
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A company™s internal ˜nancial control over ˜nancial 
reporting with reference to these Ind AS ˜nancial statements 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately 
and fairly re˚ect the transactions and dispositions of the 
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of ˜nancial statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures 
of the company are being made only in accordance with 
authorisations of management and directors of the company; 
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention 

or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company™s assets that could have a material 
effect on the ˜nancial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting With Reference to these 

Ind AS Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal ˜nancial controls 
over ˜nancial reporting with reference to these Standalone Ind 
AS ˜nancial statements, including the possibility of collusion 
or improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be 
detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal 
˜nancial controls over ˜nancial reporting with reference to 
these Standalone Ind AS ˜nancial statements to future periods 
are subject to the risk that the internal ˜nancial control over 
66
˜nancial reporting with reference to these Standalone Ind 
AS ˜nancial statements may become inadequate because of 
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with 
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Company has maintained, in all material 

respects, adequate internal ˜nancial controls over ˜nancial 
reporting with reference to these Standalone Ind AS ˜nancial 
statements and such internal ˜nancial controls over ˜nancial 
reporting with reference to these Standalone Ind AS ˜nancial 
statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 2019, 
based on the internal control over ˜nancial reporting criteria 
established by the Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on 
Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
Other Matters
Our report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy 
and operating effectiveness of the internal ˜nancial controls 
over ˜nancial reporting of the Company, insofar as it relates to 
Amalgamating Company, which is Company incorporated in 
India, is based on the corresponding report of the auditors of 
Amalgamating Company.

The ˜nancial statements were approved for issue by the 
resolution of board of directors on May 20, 2019.
2.
 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a)
 
Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements 
 
The ˜nancial statements have been prepared in 

accordance with Ind AS noti˜ed under the Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and relevant 
amendment rules issued thereafter read with Section 133 
of the Companies Act, 2013, as amended.  All accounting 
policies are consistently applied except as given below; 
 
The Company has adopted Ind AS 115 'Revenue from 

Contracts with Customers' effective April 1, 2017. 
Application of Ind AS 115 does not have any signi˜cant 
impact on retained earnings as at April 1, 2017 and 
˜nancial results of the Company.
 
The ˜nancial statements have been prepared on the going 
concern basis using historical cost convention except for 
certain ˜nancial instruments that are measured at fair 
values at the end of each reporting period, as explained in 

the accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally 
based on the fair value of the consideration given in 
exchange for goods and services. 
 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an 
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date, 
regardless of whether that price is directly observable or 
estimated using another valuation technique.
 
The fair value measurement is based on the presumption 
that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability 
takes place either. 
 
-
 
In the principal market for the asset or liabilities or
 
-
 
In the absence of a principal market in the most 

advantageous market for the asset and liabilities.  
 
In estimating the fair value of an asset or liability, the 

Company takes into account the characteristics of the 
asset or liability if market participants would take those 
characteristic into account when pricing the asset or liability 
at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement 
and/or disclosure purposes in these ˜nancial statements 
is determined on such a basis, except for share based 
payment transaction that are within the scope of Ind AS 
102 Share-based Payment, leasing transactions that are 
within the scope of Ind AS 17 Leases, and measurements 

that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair 
valued such as net realizable value in Ind AS 2 or value in 
use in Ind AS 36 Impairment of assets.
 
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured 

or disclosed in the ˜nancial statements are categorized 

within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based 
on the lowest level input that is signi˜cant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole:
 
1)
 
Level 1 Š Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active 

markets for identical assets or Liabilities.
 
2)
 
Level 2 Š Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is signi˜cant to the fair value 
measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
 
3)
 
Level 3 Š Valuation techniques for which the 

lowest level input that is signi˜cant to the fair value 
measurement is unobservable.
b)
 
Use of Estimates
 
The presentation of the ˜nancial statements are in 

conformity with the Ind AS which requires the management 
to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues 
and expenses and disclosure of contingent liabilities. Such 
estimates and assumptions are based on management's 
evaluation of relevant facts and circumstances as on the 
date of ˜nancial statements. The actual outcome may 
differ from these estimates.
 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on 

an ongoing basis. Revisions to the accounting estimates 
are recognized in the period in which the estimates are 

revised and in any future periods affected.
c)
 
Inventories
 
Inventories are stated at lower of cost on weighted 
average basis and net realizable value after providing 
for obsolescence and other losses, where considered 
necessary. Cost includes cost of purchase and other 
expenses incurred in bringing the inventories to their 
present location and condition. Cost includes all charges 
73
in bringing the goods to the point of sale, including 
receiving charges, octroi and other levies and transit 
insurance. Work-in-progress and ˜nished goods include 
appropriate proportion of overheads. Net realizable value 
represents the estimated selling price for inventories less 
all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to 
make the sale.
d)
 
Cash and cash equivalents
 
The Company considers all highly liquid ˜nancial 

instruments, which are readily convertible into known 
amounts of cash that are subject to an insigni˜cant risk 
of change in value and having original maturities of three 
months or less from the date of purchase, to be cash 
equivalents.
e)
 
Revenue from contract with customer
 
Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised 

when control of the goods or services are transferred to 
the customer at an amount that re˚ects the consideration 
to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange 
for those goods or services. 
 
Sale of goods
 
Revenue from sale of goods is recognised at the point 

in time when control of the asset is transferred to the 
customer. In determining the transaction price for the sale 
of goods, the Company considers the effects of variable 
consideration, if any.
 
Variable consideration
 
 
If the consideration in a contract includes a variable amount, 

the Company estimates the amount of consideration to 
which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the 
goods to the customer. The variable consideration is 
estimated at contract inception and constrained until it 
is highly probable that a signi˜cant revenue reversal in 
the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not 
occur when the associated uncertainty with the variable 
consideration is subsequently resolved. 
 
Contract balances 
 
Trade receivables
 
A receivable represents the Company™s right to an amount of 

consideration that is unconditional (i.e., only the passage of 
time is required before payment of the consideration is due). 
 
Interest Income
 
Interest income from ˜nancial assets is recognized when 

it is probable that the economic bene˜t will ˚ow to the 
Company and the amount of income can be measured 
reliably. Interest income is recorded using the effective 
interest rate (EIR). Interest income is accrued on a time 
basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the 
interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly 
discounts estimated future cash receipts through the 
expected life of the ˜nancial asset to that asset™s net 
carrying amount on initial recognition.
f)
 
Property, plant and equipment
 
Property, Plant & Equipment are stated at actual cost less 

accumulated depreciation and net of impairment. The 
actual cost capitalised includes material cost, freight, 
installation cost, duties and taxes and other incidental 
expenses incurred during the construction / installation 
stage.
 
Properties in course of construction for production, supply 
or administration purposes are carried at cost, less any 
recognised impairment loss. All the direct expenditure 
related to implementation including incidental expenditure 
incurred during the period of implementation of a project, 

till it is commissioned, is accounted as Capital work in 
progress (CWIP) and such properties are classi˜ed to the 
appropriate categories of property, plant and equipment 
when completed and ready for intended use.
 
All items of property, plant and equipment is derecognised 
upon disposal or when no future economic bene˜ts are 

expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any 
gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item 
of property, plant and equipment is determined as the 
difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in the statement of 
pro˜t and loss.
 
Depreciation
 
Depreciable amount for assets is the cost of an asset, 

or other amount substituted for cost, less its estimated 
residual value. Depreciation on Property, Plant and 
Equipment other than land and properties under 
construction are charged based on straight line method 
on an estimated useful life as prescribed in Schedule II to 
the Companies Act, 2013. 
 
The estimated useful lives and residual values of the 
property, plant and equipment are reviewed at the end of 
each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in 
estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.
 
Depreciation on items of property, plant and equipment 

acquired / disposed off during the year is provided on 
pro-rata basis with reference to the date of addition / 
disposal. 
74
g)
 
Intangible assets
 
Intangible assets acquired separately
 
Intangible assets with ˜nite useful lives that are 
acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortization and accumulated impairment losses. 
Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over 

their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful life are 
reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the 
effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on 
a prospective basis. 
 
Derecognition of intangible assets
 
An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when 

no future economic bene˜ts are expected from use or 
disposal. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of 
an intangible asset, measured as the difference between 
the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset, are recognised in the statement of pro˜t and loss 
when the asset is derecognised.
 
Useful lives of intangible assets
 
Intangible assets are Amortised over their estimated 

useful life on a straight-line basis over a period of 5 years 
except assets like Brand  which is amortised over 7 years 
since in the opinion of the management the bene˜ts will 
be available for that period.
h)
 
Leasing
 
Leases are classi˜ed as ˜nance leases whenever the terms 
of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classi˜ed 
as operating leases.
 
Company as a lessee
 
Assets held under ˜nance leases are initially recognised 

as an asset of the Company at their fair value at the 
inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of 
the minimum lease payments. The corresponding liability 
to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as the ˜nance 
lease obligation. 
 
Lease payments are apportioned between the ˜nance 
expenses and reduction of the lease obligation so as 
to achieve the constant rate of return on the remaining 
balance of the liability. Finance expenses are recognised 
immediately in pro˜t or loss, unless they are directly 
attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are 
capitalized in accordance with the Company™s general 
policy on borrowing costs. 
 
Rental expense from operating lease is generally 
recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
relevant lease. Where the rentals are structured solely 
to increase in line with expected general in˚ation to 

compensate for the lessors expected in˚ationary cost 
increase, such increases are recognised in the year in 
which such bene˜ts accrue.
 
Company as a lessor
 
Rental income from operating leases is generally 

recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
relevant lease. Where the rentals are structured solely 
to increase in line with expected general in˚ation to 
compensate for the Company™s expected in˚ationary cost 
increases, such increases are recognised in the year in 
which such bene˜ts accrue. Initial direct cost incurred in 
negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added 
to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised 
on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
i)
 
Foreign Currencies
 
In preparing the ˜nancial statements of the Company, the 

transactions in currencies other than the entity™s functional 
currency (INR) are recognised at the rates of exchange 
prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of 
each reporting period, monetary items denominated in 
foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate prevailing 
at that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that 
are denominated in foreign currencies are translated 
at the rates prevailing at the date when fair value was 
determined. Non-monetary items that are measured 

in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not 
retranslated.
 
Exchange differences arising on monetary items are 
recognised in the statement of pro˜t and loss in the period 
in which they arise.
j)
 
Employee Bene˜ts
 
Employee bene˜ts include provident fund, employee 

state insurance scheme, gratuity fund and compensated 
absences. 
 
De˜ned Contribution Plan: 
 
The Company™s contribution to Provident Fund is 
considered as de˜ned contribution plans and are charged 
as an expense based on the amount of contribution 
required to be made and when services are rendered by 
the employees.
 
De˜ned bene˜t plans:
 
For de˜ned bene˜t plans in the form of gratuity fund, 

the cost of providing bene˜ts is determined using 
the Projected Unit Credit method, with actuarial 
valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. 

Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, 
the effect of the changes to the return on plan assets 
75
(excluding net interest), is re˚ected immediately in the 
balance sheet with a charge or credit recognised in other 
comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. 
Remeasurement recognised in other comprehensive 
income is re˚ected immediately in retained earnings and 
is not reclassi˜ed to in the statement of pro˜t and loss. Net 
interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the 
net de˜ned bene˜t liability or asset.
 
The Company recognizes the following changes in the net 
de˜ned bene˜t obligation as an expense in the statement 
of pro˜t and loss:
 
1)
 
Service costs comprising past and current service 

costs, gains and losses on curtailments and 
settlements; and
 
2)
 
Net interest expense or income
 
The retirement bene˜t obligation recognised in the 

Balance Sheet represents the present value of the de˜ned 
bene˜t obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past 
service cost,  as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. 
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past 
service cost, plus the present value of available refunds 
and reductions in future contributions to the schemes.
 
Short-term employee bene˜ts:
 
The undiscounted amount of short-term employee 

bene˜ts expected to be paid in exchange for the services 
rendered by employees are recognised during the year 
when the employees render the service. These bene˜ts 
include compensated absences which are expected to 
occur within twelve months after the end of the period in 
which the employee renders the related service.
 
Long-term employee bene˜ts:
 
Compensated absences which are not expected to occur 

within twelve months after the end of the period in which 
the employee renders the related service are recognised as 
a liability at the present value of the estimated future cash 
out˚ows expected to be made by the Company in respect 

of services provided by employees up to the balance sheet 
date.
 
Share based payment:
 
Equity settled share based payments to employees are 
measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the 

grant date. The fair value determined at the grant date 
of the equity settled share based payments is expensed 
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on 
the Company™s estimate of equity instruments that will 
eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity. 
k)
 
Borrowing costs
 
Borrowing cost includes interest, Amortisation of ancillary 
costs incurred in connection with arrangement of 
borrowings and exchange differences arising from foreign 
currency borrowings to the extent they are regarded as an 
adjustment to the interest cost.
 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of qualifying assets, which are 
assets that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to 
get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost 
of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially 
ready for their intended use or sale.
 
Capitalization of borrowing cost is suspended and charged 
to statement of pro˜t and loss during the extended 
period when active development on the qualifying asset is 
interrupted. 
 
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the statement 

of pro˜t and loss in the period in which they are incurred.
l)
 
Earnings per share
 
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the pro˜t/

(loss) for the year attributable to equity shareholders by the 
weighted average number of equity shares outstanding 
during the year. Diluted earnings per share is computed 
by dividing the pro˜t/(loss) for the year attributable to 
equity shareholders by the weighted average number of 
equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings per 
share and the weighted average number of equity shares 
which could have been issued on the conversion of all 
dilutive potential equity shares. 
 
Potential equity shares are deemed to be dilutive only 

if their conversion to equity shares would decrease the 
net pro˜t per share from continuing ordinary operations. 
Potential dilutive equity shares are deemed to be converted 
as at the beginning of the period, unless they have been 
issued at a later date. The dilutive potential equity shares 
are adjusted for the proceeds receivable had the shares 
been actually issued at fair value (i.e. average market value 
of the outstanding shares). Dilutive potential equity shares 
are determined independently for each period presented. 
m)
 
Taxation
 
Tax expense represents the sum of the current tax and 
deferred tax.
 
Current Tax
 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable pro˜t for 
the year. Current tax is measured at the amount expected 
to be paid to the tax authorities, based on estimated tax 
76
liability computed after taking credit for allowances and 
exemption in accordance with the local tax laws. The 
Company™s current tax is calculated using tax rates that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of 
the reporting period.
 
Deferred tax
 
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences 

between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in 
the ˜nancial statements and the corresponding tax bases 
used in the computation of taxable pro˜t. Deferred tax 
liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for 
all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable pro˜ts will be available against which 
those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if 
the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition 
of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither 
the taxable pro˜t nor the accounting pro˜t. 
 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed 

at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that suf˜cient taxable 
pro˜ts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be 
recovered.
 
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax 
rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the 

liability is settled or the asset realized, based on tax rates 
(and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the end of the reporting period.
 
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets 
re˚ects the tax consequences that would follow from the 
manner in which the Company expects, at the end of the 
reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount 
of its assets and liabilities.
 
Deferred tax assets include Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) 

credit paid in accordance with the tax laws in India, which 
is likely to give future economic bene˜ts in the form of 
availability of set off against future income tax liability. 
Accordingly, MAT credit is recognised as deferred tax 
asset in the Balance sheet when the asset can be measured 
reliably and it is probable that the future economic bene˜t 
associated with the asset will be realised.
 
Current and deferred tax for the year
 
Current and deferred tax are recognised in the statement 

of pro˜t and loss, except when they relate to items that 
are recognised in other comprehensive income, in which 
case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in 
other comprehensive income. 
n)
 
Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent 
Assets and Commitments
 
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a 

present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result 
of a past event, it is probable that the Company will be 
required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate 

can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
 
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate 

of the consideration required to settle the present 
obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking 
into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the 
obligations. When a provision is measured using the cash 
˚ow estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying 
amount is the present obligations of those cash ˚ows 
(when the effect of the time value of money is material). 
 
When some or all of the economic bene˜ts required to 
settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a 
third party, a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is 
virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and 
the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.
 
Contingent liabilities and Contingent assets are not 

recognised in the ˜nancial statements when an in˚ow/ 
out˚ow of economic bene˜ts/ loss are probable.  
o)
 
Investments in subsidiaries and joint venture
 
Investments in subsidiaries and joint venture are carried 

at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Where 
an indication of impairment exists, the carrying amount of 
the investment is assessed and written down immediately 
to its recoverable amount. On disposal of investments 
in subsidiaries and joint venture, the difference between 
net disposal proceeds and the carrying amounts are 

recognised in the Statement of Pro˜t and Loss.
 
Investments in joint venture are accounted for using the 
equity method. Under the equity method the investment 
in joint venture is initially recognised at cost. The carrying 
amount of investment is adjusted to recognise changes. 
p)
 
Non-derivative Financial Instruments
 
Financial assets and ˜nancial liabilities are recognised 
when a Company becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instruments. Financial assets and ˜nancial 
liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction 

costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or 
issue of ˜nancial assets and ˜nancial liabilities (other than 
˜nancial assets and ˜nancial liabilities at fair value through 
pro˜t or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair 
value measured on initial recognition of ˜nancial assets or 
˜nancial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. 
Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of 
77
˜nancial assets or ˜nancial liabilities at fair value through 
pro˜t or loss are recognised immediately in the statement 
of pro˜t and loss.
 
Financial assets at amortised cost
 
Financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost if these ˜nancial assets are held within a business 

whose objective is to hold these assets in order to collect 
contractual cash ˚ows and the contractual terms of the 
˜nancial asset give rise on speci˜ed dates to cash ˚ows 
that are solely payments of principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding.
 
Financial assets at fair value through pro˜t or loss (FVTPL)
 
Financial assets are measured at fair value through pro˜t 

and loss unless it is measured at amortised cost or at fair 
value through other comprehensive income on initial 
recognition. The transaction costs directly attributable 
to the acquisition of ˜nancial assets and liabilities at fair 
value through pro˜t or loss are immediately recognised in 
statement of pro˜t and loss.
 
Financial liabilities
 
Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using 

the effective interest method.
 
Equity instruments
 
An equity instrument is a contract that evidences residual 

interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of 
its liabilities. Equity instruments recognised by the Company 
are measured at the proceeds received net off direct issue 
cost.
 
Offsetting of ˜nancial instruments
 
Financial assets and ˜nancial liabilities are offset and the 

net amount is reported in ˜nancial statements if there is a 
currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised 
amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to 
realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
q)
 
Derivative ˜nancial instruments
 
The Company enters into a variety of derivative ˜nancial 

instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and 
foreign exchange rate risks, including foreign exchange 
forward contracts/options and interest rate swaps. 
 
The use of foreign currency forward contracts / options 
is governed by the Company™s policies approved by the 
Board of Directors, which provide written principles on 
the use of such ˜nancial derivatives consistent with the 
Company™s risk management strategy. The counter party 
to the Company™s foreign currency forward contracts is 
generally a bank. The Company does not use derivative 
˜nancial instruments for speculative purposes.
 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the 

date the derivative contracts are entered into and are 
subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end 
of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is 
recognised in the statement of pro˜t and loss immediately.
 
Pro˜t or loss arising on cancellation or renewal of a forward 
exchange contract is recognised as income or as expense 
in the period in which such cancellation or renewal occurs. 
r)
 
Impairment
 
Financial assets (other than at fair value)
 
The Company assesses at each Balance sheet whether a 
˜nancial asset or a group of ˜nancial assets is impaired. 
Ind AS 109 requires expected credit losses to be measured 
through a loss allowance. The Company recognizes 
lifetime expected losses for all contract assets and/or 
all trade receivables that do not constitute a ˜nancing 
transaction. For all other ˜nancial assets, expected credit 
losses are measured at an amount equal to the 12 month 
expected credit losses or at an amount equal to the lifetime 
expected credit losses if the credit risk on the ˜nancial 
asset has increased signi˜cantly since initial recognition.
 
Non-˜nancial assets
 
Property, plant and Equipment and intangible assets
 
At the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews 
the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to 
determine whether there is any indication that those assets 
have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication 
exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated 
in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if 
any). When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable 
amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the 
recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which 
the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis 
of allocation can be identi˜ed, corporate assets are also 
allocated to individual cash generating units, or otherwise 
they are allocated to the smallest group of cash generating 
unit for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis 
can be identi˜ed.
 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs 

of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, 
the estimated future cash ˚ows are discounted to their 
present value using a pre-tax discount rate that re˚ects 
current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks speci˜c to the asset for which the estimates 
of future cash ˚ows have not been adjusted.
 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating 
unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the 
carrying amount of the asset (or cash generating unit) is 
reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is 
recognised immediately in the statement pro˜t and loss.
78
 
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the 
carrying amount of the asset (or a cash generating unit) is 
increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, 
but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed 
the carrying amount that would have been determined had 
no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash 
generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment 
loss is recognised immediately in the statement of pro˜t and 
loss.
s)
 
Business combinations 
 
At the time of acquisition, the Company considers whether 

each acquisition represents the acquisition of a business 
or the acquisition of an asset. The Company accounts 
for an acquisition as a business combination where an 
integrated set of activities and assets, including property, 
is acquired. More speci˜cally, consideration is given to the 
extent to which signi˜cant processes are acquired and, in 
particular, the extent of services provided by the subsidiary 
(e.g., maintenance, cleaning, security, bookkeeping, hotel 
services, etc.). 
 
Business combinations are accounted for using the 

acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured 
as the aggregate of the consideration transferred 
measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of 
any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. 
 
At the acquisition date, the identi˜able assets acquired and 

the liabilities assumed are recognised at their acquisition 
date fair values. For this purpose, the liabilities assumed 
include contingent liabilities representing present 
obligation and they are measured at their acquisition fair 
values irrespective of the fact that out˚ow of resources 
embodying economic bene˜ts is not probable. 
 
When the company acquires a business, it assesses the 
˜nancial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate 
classi˜cation and designation in accordance with the 
contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent 
conditions as at the acquisition date. 
 
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess 

of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and 
the amount recognised for non-controlling interests, and 
any previous interest held, over the net identi˜able assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net 
assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration 
transferred, the company re-assesses whether it has 
correctly identi˜ed all of the assets acquired and all of the 
liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to 
measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition 
date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the 

fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate 
consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised 
in OCI and accumulated in equity as capital reserve. 
However, if there is no clear evidence of bargain purchase, 
the entity recognises the gain directly in equity as capital 
reserve, without routing the same through OCI.
 
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less 

any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose 
of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business 
combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each 

of the company™s cash-generating units that are expected to 
bene˜t from the combination, irrespective of whether other 
assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those 
units. 
 
A cash generating unit to which goodwill has been 

allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more 
frequently when there is an indication that the unit may 
be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash 
generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the 
impairment loss is allocated ˜rst to reduce the carrying 
amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to 
the other assets of the unit pro rata based on the carrying 
amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss for 
goodwill is recognised in pro˜t or loss. An impairment loss 
recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent 
periods.
t)
 
Operating Cycle
 
The Company presents assets and liabilities in the balance 

sheet based on current / non-current classi˜cation based 
on operating cycle. 
 
An asset is treated as current when it is:
 
1.
 
Expected to be realized or intended to be sold or 

consumed in normal operating cycle;
 
2.
 
Held primarily for the purpose of trading;
 
3.
 
Expected to be realized within twelve months after 

the reporting period, or
 
4.
 
Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being 

exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least 
twelve months after the reporting period
 
All other assets are classi˜ed as non-current.
 
A liability is current when:
 
1.
 
It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle;
 
2.
 
It is held primarily for the purpose of trading;
 
3.
 
It is due to be settled within twelve months after the 
reporting period, or
 
4.
 
There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement 
of the liability for at least twelve months after the 
reporting period
79
 
All other liabilities are classi˜ed as non-current.
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classi˜ed as non-
current assets and liabilities.
u)
 
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of 

estimation uncertainty
 
The preparation of the ˜nancial statements in conformity 
with the Ind AS requires management to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of 
accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, 
liabilities and disclosures as at date of the ˜nancial 
statements and the reported amounts of the revenues 

and expenses for the years presented. The estimates 
and associated assumptions are based on historical 
experience and other factors that are considered to be 
relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates 
under different assumptions and conditions. The estimates 
and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing 
basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in 
the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision 
affects only that period, or in the period of the revision 

and future periods if the revision affects both current and 
future periods.
 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
 
 
The following are the key assumptions concerning the 

future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at 
the end of the reporting period that may have a signi˜cant 
risk of causing as material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities within next ˜nancial year. 
 
i.
 
Useful lives of property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets
  
As described in Note 2(g), the Company reviews the 

estimated useful lives and residual values, if any, of 
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 
at the end of each reporting period. During the 
current ˜nancial year, the management determined 
that there were no changes to the useful lives and 
residual values of the property plant and equipment 
and intangible assets. 
 
ii.
 
Impairment of Investment in Subsidiaries and Joint 
Venture 
  
The investment in subsidiaries and joint venture are 

tested for impairment in accordance with provisions 
applicable to impairment of non-˜nancial assets. 
The determination of recoverable amounts of the 

Company™s investments in subsidiaries and involves 
signi˜cant judgements. Market related information 
and estimates are used to determine the recoverable 
amount. Key assumptions on which management 
has based its determination of recoverable amount 
includes weighted average cost of capital and 
estimated operating margins.
  
Basis the above determination of recoverable 

amount, the management has concluded that there 
is no impairment in investments of subsidiaries and 
joint venture. 
 
iii.
 
Impairment of goodwill
  
With respect to the Goodwill of 
H
1,921.98 Lacs, 

the recoverable amount of cash generating units 
(CGU) has been determined based on value in use 
calculations. Recoverable amounts for these CGUs 
has been determined based on value in use for which 
cash ˚ow forecasts of the related CGU and discount 
rate ranging from 12.5% to 15% has been applied. 
The values assigned to the assumption re˚ect past 

experience and are consistent with the management™s 
plans for focusing operations in these markets. The 
management believes that the planned market share 
growth is reasonably achievable.
  
An analysis of the sensitivity of the computation 
to a change in key parameters (operating margin, 
discount rate and growth rate), based on a reasonable 
assumptions, did not identify any probable scenario 
in which the recoverable amount of the CGU would 
decrease below its carrying amount.

Before accepting any new customer, the Company assesses the potential customer™s credit quality and de˜nes credit limits by 
customer. Limits attributed to customers are reviewed annually. There are no customers who represent more than 5% of the 
total balance of trade receivable as at March 31, 2019 and as at March 31, 2018.

In determining the allowances for doubtful trade receivables, the Company has used a practical expedient by computing 

the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables based on a provision matrix. The provision matrix takes into account 
historical credit loss experience and is adjusted for forward looking information. The expected credit loss allowance is based 
on the ageing of the receivables that are due and rates used in the provision matrix.

Nature and Purpose of reserve
 
Capital reserve
 
The company has created capital reserve out of capital subsidies received from state Governments.
 
Securities premium
 
 
The amount received in excess of face value of the equity shares is recognised in Securities Premium. This reserve is available 

for utilization in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013. In case of equity-settled share based payment 
transactions, the difference between fair value on grant date and nominal value of share is accounted as securities premium.
 
General reserve
 
General reserve is created from time to time by way of transfer of pro˜ts from retained earnings for appropriation purposes. 

General reserve is created by a transfer from one component of equity to another and is not an item of other comprehensive 
income.
 
Revaluation Reserve
 
The company has created revaluation reserve out of revaluation of land carried out during the year 2004-05.
 
Stock Options Outstanding Account
 
The fair value of the equity-settled share based payment transactions with employees is recognised in Statement of Pro˜t and 
Loss with corresponding credit to Stock Options Outstanding Account.
 
Retained earnings
 
Retained earnings are the pro˜ts that the Company has earned till date, less any transfers to general reserve, dividends or 

other distributions paid to shareholders.
 
Shares pending allotment
 
Shares pending allotment represents equity shares to be issued pursuant to business combination. (Note 38)

Sensitivity analysis:
 
Signi˜cant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the de˜ned bene˜t obligation are discount rate, expected salary 
increase and mortality. The sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the 
respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant

The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the de˜ned bene˜t obligation as it is 
unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
 
Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the de˜ned bene˜t obligation has been 
calculated using ﬂProjected Unit Creditﬂ method at the end of the reporting period which is the same as that applied in 

calculating the de˜ned bene˜t obligation liability recognised in Balance Sheet.
 
There were no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from prior years.
 
The Company expects to make a contribution of 
H
 271.41 Lacs (as at March 31, 2018 : 
H
 84.61 Lacs) to the de˜ned bene˜t 

plans during the next ˜nancial year.

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
      
   
The Company is mainly exposed to the currency : USD,EUR and GBP.
   
The following table details,  Company™s sensitivity to a 5% increase and decrease in the rupee against the relevant 
foreign currencies. 5% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management 
personnel and represents management™s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. 
This is mainly attributable to the exposure outstanding not hedged on receivables and payables in the Company at 
the end of the reporting period. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated 

monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 5% change in foreign currency rate. A positive 
number below indicates an increase in the pro˜t and equity where the rupee strengthens 5% against the relevant 
currency. For a 5% weakening of the rupee against the relevant currency, there would be a comparable impact on 
the pro˜t and equity, and the balances below would be negative.
 
   
Impact on pro˜t or loss and total equity
   
The Company, in accordance with its risk management policies and procedures, enters into foreign currency forward 

contracts to manage its exposure in foreign exchange rate variations. The counter party is generally a bank. These 
contracts are for a period between one day and ˜ve years. The above sensitivity does not include the impact of 
foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts which largely mitigate the risk. 
  
ii
 
Interest rate risk
   
Interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash ˚ow with respect to interest payments on borrowing will ˚uctuate 

because of change in market interest rates. The company's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates 
relates primarily to the Company's long-term debt obligation with ˚oating interest rates.

MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT RISK
  
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counter party will default on its contractual obligation resulting in ˜nancial loss to the 
Company. The Company uses its own trading records to evaluate the credit worthiness of its customers. The Company™s 
exposure are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded, are spread amongst approved 
counter parties (refer note 10 - Trade receivable).
  
The company is exposed to credit risk in relation to ˜nancial guarantees given to banks in respect of borrowings obtained 

by the subsidiary company and joint venture. In case of joint Venture, the Company™s share is 50% and the guarantee has 
been given jointly and severally by all the partners of Joint Venture. 
  
The Company's maximum exposure in this respect is of 
H
7,631.03 lacs as at March 31, 2019 , 
H
7,044.61 lacs as at March 
31, 2018 as disclosed in contingent liabilities (Note 33).
 
C
 
MANAGEMENT OF LIQUIDITY RISK
      
  
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will face in meeting its obligations associated with its ˜nancial liabilities. The 

Company™s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have suf˜cient liquidity to meet its 
liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking 
damage to the Company™s reputation.
 
  
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has established an 

appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Company™s short-term, medium-term 
and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining 
adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual 

cash ˚ows, and by matching the maturity pro˜les of ˜nancial assets and liabilities.
  
The following table shows the maturity analysis of the Company™s ˜nancial liabilities based on contractually agreed 

undiscounted cash ˚ows along with its carrying value as at the Balance Sheet date.

42 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT
The below amendments have also became effective for the company from ˜nancial year beginning April 1, 2018. However, 

the management has evaluated and determined that the adoption of these amendments will not have any material impact on 
the standalone ˜nancial statements since there are no such transactions or the company™s existing policies are aligned to these 
amendments:
1.
 
Amendment to Ind AS 12 Income Taxes Œ regarding recognition of deferred tax assets on unrealised losses
2.
 
Applying Appendix B of Ind AS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates
3.
 
Amendment to Ind AS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
4.
 
Amendment to Ind AS 40 Investment Property - regarding transfer of investment property
5.
 
Amendment to Ind AS 112 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities Œ regarding disclosure requirements
Standards issued but not yet effective

Ind AS 116 Œ Leases

Ind AS 116 Leases was noti˜ed by MCA on 30 March 2019 and it replaces Ind AS 17 Leases, including appendices thereto. Ind 
AS 116 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 April 2019. Ind AS 116 sets out the principles for the recognition, 
measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases and requires lessees to account for all leases under a single on-balance sheet 
model similar to the accounting for ˜nance leases under Ind AS 17. Lessees will be required to separately recognise the interest 
expense on the lease liability and the depreciation expense on the right-of-use asset.  
The company intends to adopt these standards from 1 April 2019. As the company does not have any material leases, therefore 
the adoption of this standard is not likely to have a material impact in its Standalone Financial Statements.
107
43 EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD 
The Board of Directors, in its meeting held on May 20, 2019, has proposed a ˜nal dividend of 
H 
0.40 per equity share for the 
˜nancial year ended March 31, 2019. The proposal is subject to the approval of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and 
if approved would result in a cash out˚ow of approximately 
H
581.22 Lacs, including dividend distribution tax.
44 
The ˜gures for the previous year have been regrouped/ reclassi˜ed wherever necessary to con˜rm with the current year™s 
classi˜cation. Moreover, due to merger, ˜gures for the current year is not comparable with the previous year to that extent.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR™S REPORT
To the Members of 
Astral Poly Technik Limited
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Ind AS 
Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Ind AS 
˜nancial statements of Astra Poly Technik Limited (hereinafter 
referred to as ﬁthe Holding Companyﬂ), its subsidiaries (the 
Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as 
ﬁthe Groupﬂ) its joint venture  comprising of the consolidated 
Balance sheet as at March 31, 2019, the consolidated Statement 
of Pro˜t and Loss, including other comprehensive income, 
the consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, 
and notes to the Consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial statements, 
including a summary of signi˜cant accounting policies and 
other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as ﬁthe 
Consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial statementsﬂ).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according 
to the explanations given to us and based on the consideration 
of reports of other auditors on separate ˜nancial statements 
and on the other ˜nancial information of the subsidiaries and

Act, 2013 (ﬁthe Actﬂ) in the manner so required and give a 
true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs 
of the Group, its joint venture  as at March 31, 2019, their 
Consolidated pro˜t including other comprehensive income, 
their consolidated cash ˚ows and the consolidated statement 
of changes in equity for the year ended on that date. 
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the Consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial 
statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing 
(SAs), as speci˜ed under section 143(10) of the Act. Our 

responsibilities under those Standards are further described in 
the ‚Auditor™s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated 
Ind AS Financial Statements™ section of our report. We are 

independent of the Group in accordance with the ‚Code of 
Ethics™ issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India 
together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the ˜nancial statements under the provisions of the Act 

and the Rules thereunder, and we have ful˜lled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the 
Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is suf˜cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinion on the Consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most signi˜cance in our audit of the 
Consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial statements for the ˜nancial 
year ended March 31, 2019. These matters were addressed in 
the context of our audit of the Consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 
For each matter below, our description of how our audit 
addressed the matter is provided in that context. 
We have determined the matters described below to be 
the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. We 
have ful˜lled the responsibilities described in the Auditor™s 
responsibilities for the audit of the Consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial 
statements section of our report, including in relation to these 
matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of 
procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks 
of material misstatement of the Consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial 
statements. The results of our audit procedures, including 
the procedures performed to address the matters below, 
provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying 
Consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial statements.
Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Impairment of Goodwill (as described in note 2 (v)(iii) of the Consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial statements)
The Group™s balance sheet includes 
H 
25,378.06 lacs of goodwill, 
representing 12% of total Group assets. In accordance with 
Ind AS 36, these balances are allocated to Cash Generating 
Units (CGUs) which are tested annually for impairment using 
discounted cash-˚ow models of each CGU™s recoverable value 
compared to the carrying value of the assets. A de˜cit between 

the recoverable value and the CGU™s net assets would result in 
impairment.
The inputs to the impairment testing model which have the most 
signi˜cant impact on CGU recoverable value include:
We performed following procedures, among others:
Ł
 
We assessed whether the Group™s de˜nition of the CGUs 
is compliant with the applicable accounting standards 
Ł
 
We evaluated the forecast of future cash ˚ows used by the 

management in the model to compute the recoverable 
value of CGUs.
Ł
 
We compared the forecast of future cash ˚ows to 
business plan and previous forecasts to the actual results
109
Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
-
 
Projected revenue growth, operating margins and operating 
cash-˚ows; and
-
 
Business speci˜c discount rates 
The annual impairment testing is considered a signi˜cant 

accounting judgement and estimate [Note 2(v)(iii)] and a key 
audit matter because the assumptions on which the tests are 
based are highly judgmental and are affected by future market 
and economic conditions which are inherently uncertain, and 
because of the materiality of the balances to the Consolidated 
Ind AS ˜nancial statements.
Ł
 
We focused our analysis on management assumptions 
in respect of future sales growth rate and discount rate 
used to compute the recoverable value of CGUs.
Ł
 
We recalculated estimates using the management 
model.
Ł
 
We involved valuation specialists to assist in evaluating 

the key assumptions and methodologies used by the 
Holding Company in computing the recoverable value 
of CGUs. 
Ł
 
We assessed the disclosures made in the Consolidated 

Ind AS ˜nancial statements. 
Business Combination (Refer note no. 42 of the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements
During the year, the Group has acquired 51% of equity shares 
of Rex Polyextrusion Private Limited (ﬁAmalgamating Companyﬂ) 
against cash consideration and subsequently merged 
Amalgamating Company with the Holding Company by buying 
out minority shareholders by issuing Company™s own equity 
shares against the balance 49% of equity shares held by minority 
shareholders. 
The fair value of the consideration transferred amounted to 
 
H 
14,750.00 lacs in total. The allocation of the purchase price 
to identi˜able assets and liabilities acquired was performed by 
the Group with support from external advisors and lead to the 
recognition of Goodwill of 
H 
1,921.98 lacs. 
The individual assets acquired, especially Brands, have 
no observable market values are available. To determine 
the corresponding fair values, valuation models based on 
assumptions are used. This measurement is dependent on 
estimates of future cash ˚ows as well as the discount rate applied 
and, subject to considerable uncertainty.
Accounting for acquisitions requires the application of complex 
accounting policies, mainly Ind AS 103 Business Combinations, 
and involves signi˜cant judgments and assumptions and hence 

considered a key audit matter.
With respect to the accounting for the acquisition:
Ł
 
We have read the relevant parts of the purchase 
agreements, scheme of amalgamation for the merger 
of Amalgamating Company with the Holding Company, 
obtained an understanding of the deal structure and 
evaluated the accounting treatment in accordance 
with Ind AS 103. This included the evaluation of the 
interpretation of speci˜c sections of the agreements and 
the application of accounting policies to thereon.
Ł
 
We evaluated the quali˜cations and objectivity of the 

experts engaged by the Group to perform the purchase 
price allocation.
Ł
 
We have recalculated the model using the management 
inputs and assumptions for ascertaining mathematical 
accuracy. 
Ł
 
We compared the inputs in the model to internal and 
external data.
Ł
 
We focused our analysis on management assumptions 
in respect of future sales growth rate and discount rate 
used in valuation.
Ł
 
We involved valuation specialists to assist in evaluating 

the key assumptions and methodologies 
Ł
 
We assessed the disclosures made in the Consolidated 
Ind AS Financial Statements. 
Other Information 
The Holding Company™s Board of Directors is responsible for 
the other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the Annual report with respect to the 
following sections, but does not include the Consolidated Ind 
AS ˜nancial statements and our auditor™s report thereon. 
Our opinion on the Consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial statements 
does not cover the other information and we do not express 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the Consolidated Ind AS 
˜nancial statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other 
information is materially inconsistent with the Consolidated 
Ind AS Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in 
the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, 
based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there 
is a material misstatement of this other information, we are 
required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this 
regard.
Responsibilities of Management for the 
Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements
The Holding Company™s Board of Directors is responsible for 
the preparation and presentation of these Consolidated Ind 
AS ˜nancial statements in terms of the requirements of the 
Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated ˜nancial 
position, consolidated ˜nancial performance including 
110
other comprehensive income, consolidated cash ˚ows and 
consolidated statement of changes in equity of the Group 
including its joint venture in accordance with the accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian 
Accounting Standards (Ind AS) speci˜ed under section 
133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. The respective Board of 
Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its 
joint ventures  are responsible for maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the 
Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Group and of its 
joint venture and for preventing and detecting frauds and 
other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate 
accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal ˜nancial controls, 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the 

preparation and presentation of the Consolidated Ind AS 
˜nancial statements that give a true and fair view and are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the 
Consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial statements by the Directors of 
the Holding Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements, the 
respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the 
Group and of its joint venture are responsible for assessing the 
ability of the Group and of its joint 
venture to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless management either 
intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has 
no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those respective Board of Directors of the companies included 
in the Group and of its joint venture are also responsible for 
overseeing the ˜nancial reporting process of the Group and 
of its joint venture.
Auditor™s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the Consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial statements as a 
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and to issue an auditor™s report that includes 
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to in˚uence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these Consolidated 
Ind AS ˜nancial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 

professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
Ł
 
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of 
the Consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial statements, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that 
is suf˜cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal 
control. 
Ł
 
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 

the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 

appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the Holding Company has adequate 
internal ˜nancial controls system in place and the 
operating effectiveness of such controls.
Ł
 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by management. 
Ł
 
Conclude on the appropriateness of management™s use of 

the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the 
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty 
exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
signi˜cant doubt on the ability of the Group and its joint 
venture to continue as a going concern. If we conclude 
that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in our auditor™s report to the related disclosures 
in the Consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up 
to the date of our auditor™s report. However, future events 

or conditions may cause the Group and its joint venture to 
cease to continue as a going concern. 
Ł
 
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the Consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial statements, including 
the disclosures, and whether the Consolidated Ind AS 

˜nancial statements represent the underlying transactions 
and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 
Ł
 
Obtain suf˜cient appropriate audit evidence regarding the 
˜nancial information of the entities or business activities 
within the Group and its joint venture of which we are the 
independent auditors and whose ˜nancial information we 
have audited, to express an opinion on the Consolidated 
Ind AS ˜nancial statements. We are responsible for the 
direction, supervision and performance of the audit of 
the ˜nancial statements of such entities included in the 
Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements of which we are 
111
the independent auditors. For the other entities included 
in the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements, which 
have been audited by other auditors, such other auditors 
remain responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain 
solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance of the 
Holding Company and such other entities included in the 
Consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial statements of which we are the 
independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and signi˜cant audit 
˜ndings, including any signi˜cant de˜ciencies in internal 
control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a 
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and 
where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
signi˜cance in the audit of the Consolidated Ind AS ˜nancial 
statements for the ˜nancial year ended March 31, 2019 and 
are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters 
in our auditor™s report unless law or regulation precludes 
public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely 
rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should 
not be communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to 
outweigh the public interest bene˜ts of such communication.

Annexure to the Independent Auditor™s report of even date on the Consolidated Ind AS Financial 
Statements of Astral Poly Technik Limited 
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under 
Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the 

Companies Act, 2013 (ﬁthe Actﬂ)
In conjunction with our audit of the Consolidated Ind AS 
˜nancial statements of Astral Poly Technik Limited as of and for 
the year ended March 31, 2019, we have audited the internal 
˜nancial controls over ˜nancial reporting of Astral Poly Technik 
Limited (hereinafter referred to as the ﬁHolding Companyﬂ) and 
its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in 
India, as of that date.
Management™s Responsibility for Internal 
Financial Controls
The respective Board of Directors of the Holding Company and 
its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in 
India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal 

˜nancial controls based on the internal control over ˜nancial 
reporting criteria established by the Holding Company 
considering the essential components of internal control 
stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial 
Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities include 
the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate 
internal ˜nancial controls that were operating effectively for 
ensuring the orderly and ef˜cient conduct of its business, 
including adherence to the respective company™s policies, 

the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection 
of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable 
˜nancial information, as required under the Act. 
Auditor™s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Holding 
company™s internal ˜nancial controls over ˜nancial reporting 
based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with 
the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting (the ﬁGuidance Noteﬂ) and the Standards 
on Auditing, both, issued by Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of India, and deemed to be prescribed under section 143(10) 
of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal 
˜nancial controls.  Those Standards and the Guidance Note 
require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether adequate internal ˜nancial controls over ˜nancial 
reporting was established and maintained and if such controls 
operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal ˜nancial controls 
over ˜nancial reporting with reference to the consolidated 
˜nancial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our 
audit of internal ˜nancial controls over ˜nancial reporting 

included obtaining an understanding of internal ˜nancial 
controls over ˜nancial reporting, assessing the risk that a 
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the 
design and operating effectiveness of internal control based 
on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the 
auditor™s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the ˜nancial statements, whether due 
to fraud or error. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and 
the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms 
of their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph 
below, is suf˜cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinion on the internal ˜nancial controls over ˜nancial 
reporting with reference to these consolidated ˜nancial 
statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting 
A company™s internal ˜nancial control over ˜nancial reporting 
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of ˜nancial reporting and the 
preparation of ˜nancial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A 
company™s internal ˜nancial control over ˜nancial reporting 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately 
and fairly re˚ect the transactions and dispositions of the 
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of ˜nancial statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures 
of the company are being made only in accordance with 
authorisations of management and directors of the company; 
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention 
or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company™s assets that could have a material 

effect on the ˜nancial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting
Because of the inherent limitations of internal ˜nancial controls 
over ˜nancial reporting, including the possibility of collusion 
or improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be 
detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal 
˜nancial controls over ˜nancial reporting to future periods 
are subject to the risk that the internal ˜nancial control over 
˜nancial reporting may become inadequate because of 
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with 
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
114
Opinion
In our opinion, the Holding Company and its subsidiary 
companies which are companies incorporated in India, have, 
maintained in all material respects, an adequate internal 
˜nancial controls system over ˜nancial reporting and such 
internal ˜nancial controls over ˜nancial reporting were 
operating effectively as at March 31, 2019, based on the 
internal control over ˜nancial reporting criteria established by 
the Holding Company considering the essential components 
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of 
Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
Other Matters
Our report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy 

and operating effectiveness of the internal ˜nancial controls 
over ˜nancial reporting of the Holding Company, insofar as it 
relates to subsidiary companies and Amalgamating Company, 
which are companies incorporated in India, are based on 
the corresponding reports of the auditors of such subsidiary 
companies and Amalgamating Company, incorporated in India.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:-
a)
 
Basis of Preparation of Consolidated Financial 

Statements 
 
The Consolidated ˜nancial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with Ind AS noti˜ed under the 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 
and relevant amendment rules issued thereafter read with 
Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, as amended. 
All accounting policies are consistently applied except as 
given below;
 
The Company has adopted Ind AS 115 ‚Revenue from 

Contracts with Customers™ effective April 1, 2017. 
Application of Ind AS 115 does not have any signi˜cant 
impact on retained earnings as at April 1, 2017 and 
˜nancial results of the Company.
 
The Consolidated ˜nancial statements have been 
prepared on the going concern basis using historical cost 

convention except for certain ˜nancial instruments that 
are measured at fair values at the end of each reporting 
period, as explained in the accounting policies below. 
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the 
consideration given in exchange for goods and services.
 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an 

asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 

between market participants at the measurement date, 
regardless of whether that price is directly observable or 
estimated using another valuation technique.
 
The fair value measurement is based on the presumption 

that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability 
takes place either. 
 
-
 
In the principal market for the asset or liabilities or
 
-
 
In the absence of a principal market in the most 
advantageous market for the asset and liabilities.  
 
In estimating the fair value of an asset or liability, the Group 
takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability 
if market participants would take those characteristic 
into account when pricing the asset or liability at the 
measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/
or disclosure purposes in these Consolidated ˜nancial 
statements is determined on such a basis, except for share 

based payment transaction that are within the scope of Ind 
AS 102 Share-based Payment, leasing transactions that are 
within the scope of Ind AS 17 Leases, and measurements 
that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair 
valued such as net realizable value in Ind AS 2 or value in 
use in Ind AS 36 Impairment of assets.
 
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured 

or disclosed in the Consolidated ˜nancial statements are 
categorized within the fair value hierarchy, described as 
follows, based on the lowest level input that is signi˜cant 
to the fair value measurement as a whole:
 
1)
 
Level 1 Š Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active 

markets for identical assets or Liabilities.
 
2)
 
Level 2 Š Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is signi˜cant to the fair value 
measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
 
3)
 
Level 3 Š Valuation techniques for which the 

lowest level input that is signi˜cant to the fair value 
measurement is unobservable.
b)
 
Basis of Consolidation
 
The consolidated ˜nancial statements incorporate 

the ˜nancial statements of the Company and entities 
controlled by the Company and its subsidiaries. Control is 
achieved when the Company:
 
Ł
 
has power over the investee:
 
Ł
 
is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its 
involvement with the investee; and
 
Ł
 
has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
 
The company reassesses whether or not it controls an 

investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are 
changes to one or more of the three elements of control 
121
listed above. When the Company has less than a majority 
of the voting rights of an investee, it has power over the 
investee when the voting rights are suf˜cient to give it 
the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the 
investee unilaterally. The Company considers all relevant 
facts and circumstances in assessing whether or not the 
Company™s voting rights in an investee are suf˜cient to 
give it power, including:
 
Ł
 
the size of the Company™s holding of voting rights 
relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of the 
other vote holders;
 
Ł
 
potential voting rights held by the Company, other 

vote holders or other parties;
 
Ł
 
rights arising from other contractual arrangements; 
and
 
Ł
 
any additional facts and circumstances when the 

Company obtains control over the subsidiary and 
ceases when the Company loses control of the 
subsidiary. Speci˜cally, income and expenses of a 
subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year 
are included in the consolidated statement of pro˜t 
and loss from the date the company gains control until 
the date when the Company ceases to control the 
subsidiary.
 
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company 

obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the 
Company loses control of the subsidiary. Speci˜cally, 
income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed 
of during the year are included in the Consolidated 
Statement of Pro˜t and Loss from the date the Company 
gains control until the date when the Company ceases to 
control the subsidiary.
 
Pro˜t or loss and each component of other comprehensive 

income are attributed to the owners of the Company and 
to the non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive 
income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the 
Company and to the non-controlling interests even if this 
results in the non-controlling interests having a de˜cit 
balance. 
 
When necessary, adjustments are made to the ˜nancial 
statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting 
policies into line with the Group™s accounting policies. The 
˜nancial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries 
have been combined on a line-by-line basis by adding 
together the book values of like items of assets, liabilities, 
income and expenses, after eliminating intra-group 
balances, intra-group transactions and the unrealised 
pro˜ts/losses, unless cost/revenue cannot be recovered. 
The excess of cost to the Group of its investment in 
subsidiaries, on the acquisition dates over and above the 
Group™s share of equity in the subsidiaries, is recognised 
as ‚Goodwill on Consolidation™ being an asset in the 
consolidated ˜nancial statements. The said Goodwill 
is not amortised, however, it is tested for impairment at 
each Balance Sheet date and the impairment loss, if any, 
is provided for. On the other hand, where the share of 
equity in subsidiaries as on the date of investment is in 
excess of cost of investments of the Group, it is recognised 
as ‚Capital Reserve™ and shown under the head ‚Reserves 
and Surplus™ in the consolidated ˜nancial statements.
 
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated 
subsidiaries is identi˜ed and presented in the consolidated 
Balance Sheet separately within equity.
 
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated 

subsidiaries consists of:
 
(a)
 
The amount of equity attributable to non-controlling 
interests at the date on which investment in a 
subsidiary is made; and
 
(b)
 
The non-controlling interests share of movements in 

equity since the date parent subsidiary relationship 
came into existence.
c)
 
Investment in Joint Venture
 
A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties 

that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to 
the net assets of the joint arrangement. Joint control is the 
contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, 
which exists only when decision about the relevant 
activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing 
control.
 
The results and assets and liabilities of joint venture are 

incorporated in these consolidated ˜nancial statements 
using the equity method of accounting, except when the 
investment or a portion thereof is classi˜ed as held for sale, 
in which case it is accounted for in accordance with Ind AS 
105. Under equity method, an investment in a joint venture 
is initially recognised in the consolidated balance sheet at 
cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group™s share 
of the pro˜t and loss and other comprehensive income of 
the joint venture. When the Group™s share of losses of a joint 
venture exceeds the Group™s interest in that joint venture 
(which includes any long term interest that, in substance, 
form part of Group™s net investment in the joint venture), the 
Group discontinues recognizing its share of further losses. 
Additional losses are recognised only to the extent that 
the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or 
made payments on behalf of the joint venture.
 
An investment in a joint venture is accounted for using 

the equity method from the date on which the investee 
becomes a joint venture. On acquisition of the investment 
in joint venture, any excess of cost of the investment over 
122
the Group™s share of net fair value of the identi˜able 
assets and liabilities of the investee is recognised as 
goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount 
of the investment. Any excess of the Group™s share of net 
fair value of the identi˜able assets and liabilities over the 
cost of the investment, after reassessment, is recognised 
directly in equity as capital reserve in the period in which 
the investment is acquired.
 
After application of the equity method of accounting, 
the Group determines whether there any is objective 
evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events 
that occurred after the initial recognition of the net 
investment in a joint venture and that event (or events) 
has an impact on the estimated future cash ˚ows from 
the net investment that can be reliably estimated. If there 
exists such an objective evidence of impairment, then it 
is necessary to recognise impairment loss with respect to 
the Group™s investment in a joint venture.
 
When necessary, the entire carrying amount of the 

investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment 
in accordance with Ind AS 36 Œ Impairment of assets as a 
single asset by comparing its recoverable amount (higher 
of value in use and fair value less costs of disposables) with 

its carrying amount, any impairment loss recognised forms 
part of the carrying amount of the investment. Any reversal 
of the impairment loss is recognised in accordance with 
Ind AS 36 to the extent that the recoverable amount of the 
investment subsequently increases.
 
When a Group entity transacts with a joint venture of the 
Group, pro˜t and losses resulting from the transaction 
with the joint venture are recognised in the Group™s 
consolidated ˜nancial statements only to the extent of 
interest in joint venture that are not related to the Group.
 
The ˜nancial statements of the joint venture used in 

applying the equity method are prepared as of a date 
different from that used by the entity, adjustments are 
made for the effects of signi˜cant transactions or events 
that occur between that date and the date of the entity™s 
˜nancial statements. The difference between the end of 
the reporting period of the joint venture and that of the 
Company is of three months. The length of the reporting 
periods and difference between the ends of the reporting 
periods are same from period to period. 
d)
 
Inventories
 
Inventories are stated at lower of cost on weighted 
average basis or net realizable value after providing 
for obsolescence and other losses, where considered 
necessary. Cost includes cost of purchase and other 

expenses incurred in bringing the inventories to their 
present location and condition. Cost includes all charges 
in bringing the goods to the point of sale, including 
receiving charges, octroi and other levies and transit 

insurance. Work-in-progress and ˜nished goods include 
appropriate proportion of overheads. Net realizable value 
represents the estimated selling price for inventories less 
all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to 
make the sale.
e)
 
Cash and cash equivalents
 
The Group considers all highly liquid ˜nancial instruments, 

which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash 
that are subject to an insigni˜cant risk of change in value 
and having original maturities of three months or less from 
the date of purchase, to be cash equivalents.
f)
 
Revenue from contract with customer
 
Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised 

when control of the goods or services are transferred to 
the customer at an amount that re˚ects the consideration 
to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for 
those goods or services. 
 
Sale of goods
 
Revenue from sale of goods is recognised at the point 

in time when control of the asset is transferred to the 
customer. In determining the transaction price for the 
sale of goods, the Group considers the effects of variable 
consideration, if any.
 
Variable consideration 
 
If the consideration in a contract includes a variable 

amount, the Group estimates the amount of consideration 
to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring 
the goods to the customer. The variable consideration is 
estimated at contract inception and constrained until it 
is highly probable that a signi˜cant revenue reversal in 
the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not 
occur when the associated uncertainty with the variable 
consideration is subsequently resolved.
 
Contract balances 
 
Trade receivables
 
A receivable represents the Group™s right to an amount of 

consideration that is unconditional (i.e., only the passage of 
time is required before payment of the consideration is due)
 
Interest Income
 
Interest income from ˜nancial assets is recognised when it 

is probable that the economic bene˜t will ˚ow to the Group 
and the amount of income can be measured reliably. Interest 
income is recorded using the effective interest rate (EIR). 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to 
the principal outstanding and the interest rate applicable, 
123
which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future 
cash receipts through the expected life of the ˜nancial asset 
to that asset™s net carrying amount on initial recognition.
g)
 
Property, plant and equipment
 
Property, Plant and Equipment are stated at actual cost less 
accumulated depreciation and of impairment. The actual 

cost capitalised includes material cost, freight, installation 
cost, duties and taxes and other incidental expenses 
incurred during the construction / installation stage.
 
Properties in the course of construction for production, 

supply or administration purposes are carried at cost, 

less any recognised impairment loss. All the direct 
expenditure related to implementation including 
incidental expenditure incurred during the period of 
implementation of a project, till it is commissioned, is 
accounted as Capital work in progress (CWIP) and such 
properties are classi˜ed to the appropriate categories 
of property, plant and equipment when completed and 
ready for intended use.
 
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised 

upon disposal or when no future economic bene˜ts are 
expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any 
gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item 
of property, plant and equipment is determined as the 
difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in the consolidated 

statement of pro˜t and loss.
 
Depreciation
 
Depreciable amount for assets is the cost of an asset, or 
other amount substituted for cost, less its estimated residual 
value. Depreciation on Property, Plant and Equipment other 

than freehold land and properties under construction are 
charged based on straight line method on an estimated 
useful life as prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 
2013. 
 
The estimated useful lives and residual values of the 
property, plant and equipment are reviewed at the end of 
each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in 
estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.
 
Asset held under ˜nance leases are depreciated over 

their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned 
assets. However, when there is no reasonable certainty 
that ownership will be obtained by the end of lease term, 
assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term 
and their useful lives.
 
Depreciation on items of property, plant and equipment 
acquired / disposed off during the year is provided on pro-
rata basis with reference to the date of addition / disposal.
h)
 
Intangible assets
 
Intangible assets acquired separately
 
Intangible assets with ˜nite useful lives that are 

acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. 
Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over 

their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful life is 
reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the 
effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on 
a prospective basis. 
 
Derecognition of intangible assets
 
An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when 

no future economic bene˜ts are expected from use or 
disposal. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of 
an intangible asset, measured as the difference between 
the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset, are recognised in the consolidated statement of 
pro˜t and loss when the asset is derecognised.
 
Useful lives of intangible assets
 
Intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful 

life on a straight-line basis over a period of 5 years except 
assets like Brand which is amortised over 7 years since 
in the opinion of the management the bene˜ts will be 
available for that period. 
i)
 
Leasing
 
Leases are classi˜ed as ˜nance leases whenever the terms 
of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classi˜ed 
as operating leases.
 
Group as a lessee
 
Assets held under ˜nance leases are initially recognised as 

an asset of the Group at their fair value at the inception of 
the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments. The corresponding liability to the lessor is 
included in the consolidated Balance Sheet as a ˜nance lease 
obligation. 
 
Lease payments are apportioned between the ˜nance 
expenses and reduction of the lease obligation so as 
to achieve the constant rate of return on the remaining 
balance of the liability. Finance expenses are recognised 
immediately in pro˜t or loss, unless they are directly 
attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are 
capitalized in accordance with the Group™s general policy 
on borrowing costs. 
 
Rental expense from operating lease is generally 
recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the 
124
relevant lease. Where the rentals are structured solely 
to increase in line with expected general in˚ation to 
compensate for the lessors expected in˚ationary cost 
increase, such increases are recognised in the year in 
which such bene˜ts accrue.
 
Group as a lessor
 
Rental income from operating leases is generally 

recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the 
relevant lease. Where the rentals are structured solely 
to increase in line with expected general in˚ation to 
compensate for the Group™s expected in˚ationary cost 
increases, such increases are recognised in the year in 
which such bene˜ts accrue. Initial direct cost incurred in 
negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added 
to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised 
on a straight line basis over the lease term.
j)
 
Foreign Currencies
 
In preparing the consolidated ˜nancial statements of the 

Group, the transactions in currencies other than the entity™s 
functional currency (INR) are recognised at the rates of 
exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the 
end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated 
in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate prevailing 
at that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that 
are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the 
rates prevailing at the date when fair value was determined. 

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical 
cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
 
Exchange differences arising on monetary items are 
recognised in the consolidated statement of pro˜t and 
loss in the period in which they arise.
 
Translation of Financial Statements of foreign entities
 
On Consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign 

operations are translated into INR at the rate of exchange 
prevailing at the reporting date and their statements of 
Pro˜t and Loss are translated at the average exchange 
rates for the period. On disposal of foreign operation, the 
component of OCI relating to that particular operation is 
recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Pro˜t and 
Loss.
k)
 
Employee Bene˜ts
 
Employee bene˜ts include provident fund, employee 

state insurance scheme, gratuity fund and compensated 
absences.
 
De˜ned Contribution Plan: 
 
The Group™s contribution to Provident Fund is considered 

as de˜ned contribution plans and is charged as an expense 
based on the amount of contribution required to be made 

and when services are rendered by the employees. The 
Parent Company and its Indian Subsidiaries operate 
de˜ned contribution plans pertaining to ESIC and 
Provident fund scheme for eligible employees.
 
De˜ned bene˜t plans:
 
The Parent company and its Indian Subsidiaries operate 

a gratuity scheme for employees. The cost of providing 
bene˜ts is determined using the Projected Unit Credit 
method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at 
each balance sheet date. Remeasurement, comprising 
actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the changes to the 
return on plan assets (excluding net interest), is re˚ected 
immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit 
recognised in other comprehensive income in the period 
in which they occur. Remeasurement recognised in 
other comprehensive income is re˚ected immediately 
in retained earnings and is not reclassi˜ed to in the 
consolidated statement of pro˜t and loss. Net interest is 
calculated by applying the discount rate to the net de˜ned 
bene˜t liability or asset.
 
The Group recognises the following changes in the 

net de˜ned bene˜t obligation as an expense in the 
consolidated statement of pro˜t and loss:
 
1)
 
Service costs comprising current service costs, gains 
and losses on curtailments and settlements; and
 
2)
 
Net interest expense or income
 
The retirement bene˜t obligation recognised in the 

Consolidated Balance Sheet represents the present 
value of the de˜ned bene˜t obligation as adjusted for 
unrecognised past service cost,  as reduced by the fair 

value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this 
calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present 
value of available refunds and reductions in future 
contributions to the schemes.
 
Short-term employee bene˜ts:
 
The undiscounted amount of short-term employee 

bene˜ts expected to be paid in exchange for the services 
rendered by employees are recognised during the year 
when the employees render the service. These bene˜ts 
include compensated absences which are expected to 
occur within twelve months after the end of the period in 
which the employee renders the related service.
 
Long-term employee bene˜ts:
 
Compensated absences which are not expected to occur 

within twelve months after the end of the period in which 
the employee renders the related service are recognised 
as a liability at the present value of the estimated future 
125
NOTES FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31,2019
cash out˚ows expected to be made by the Group in 
respect of services provided by employees up to the 
balance sheet date. The Group determines the liability for 
such accumulated leaves using the Projected Unit Credit 
Method with actuarial valuations being carried out at each 
Balance Sheet date.
 
Share based payment:
 
Equity settled share based payments to employees are 

measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the 
grant date. The fair value determined at the grant date of 
the equity settled share based payments is expensed on 
a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the 
Group™s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually 
vest, with a corresponding increase in equity.
l)
 
Borrowing costs
 
Borrowing cost includes interest, amortisation of ancillary 

costs incurred in connection with the arrangement of 
borrowings and exchange differences arising from foreign 
currency borrowings to the extent they are regarded as an 
adjustment to the interest cost.
 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 

construction or production of qualifying assets, which are 
assets that necessarily takes a substantial period of time 
to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to 
the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are 
substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
 
Capitalization of borrowing cost is suspended and charged 
to statement of Pro˜t and loss during the extended 
period when active development of the qualifying asset is 
interrupted.
 
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the 

consolidated statement of pro˜t and loss in the period in 
which they are incurred.
m)
 
Earnings per share
 
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the pro˜t/

(loss) for the year attributable to equity shareholders by the 

weighted average number of equity shares outstanding 
during the year. Diluted earnings per share is computed 
by dividing the pro˜t/(loss) for the year attributable to 
equity shareholders by the weighted average number of 

equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings per 
share and the weighted average number of equity shares 
which could have been issued on the conversion of all 
dilutive potential equity shares. 
 
Potential equity shares are deemed to be dilutive only 

if their conversion to equity shares would decrease the 
net pro˜t per share from continuing ordinary operations. 
Potential dilutive equity shares are deemed to be converted 
as at the beginning of the period, unless they have been 

issued at a later date. The dilutive potential equity shares 
are adjusted for the proceeds receivable had the shares 
been actually issued at fair value (i.e. average market value 
of the outstanding shares). Dilutive potential equity shares 
are determined independently for each period presented.
n)
 
Taxation
 
Tax expense represents the sum of the current tax and 
deferred tax.
 
Current Tax
 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable pro˜t for 

the year. Current tax is measured at the amount expected 
to be paid to the tax authorities, based on estimated tax 
liability computed after taking credit for allowances and 
exemption in accordance with the local tax laws existing 
in the respective countries. The Group™s current tax is 
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
 
Deferred tax
 
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences 

between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in 
the ˜nancial statements and the corresponding tax bases 
used in the computation of taxable pro˜t. Deferred tax 
liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for 
all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable pro˜ts will be available against which 
those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if 
the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition 

of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither 
the taxable pro˜t nor the accounting pro˜t.
 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed 
at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that suf˜cient taxable 
pro˜ts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be 
recovered.
 
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax 

rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the 
liability is settled or the asset realized, based on tax rates 
(and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the end of the reporting period.
 
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets 
re˚ects the tax consequences that would follow from the 
manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the 
reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount 
of its assets and liabilities.
126
 
Deferred tax assets include Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) 
credit paid in accordance with the tax laws in India, which 
is likely to give future economic bene˜ts in the form of 
availability of set off against future income tax liability. 
Accordingly, MAT credit is recognised as deferred tax 
asset in the Consolidated Balance sheet when the asset 
can be measured reliably and it is probable that the 
future economic bene˜t associated with the asset will be 
realised.
 
The deferred tax assets (net) and deferred tax liabilities 
(net) are determined separately for the Parent and each 
subsidiary company as per their applicable laws and then 
aggregated.
 
MAT credit is recognised as an asset only when and to the 

extent there is convincing evidence that the respective 
Group Company will pay normal tax during the speci˜ed 
period. Such asset is reviewed at each Balance sheet 
date and the carrying amount of the MAT credit asset is 
written down to the extent there is no longer a convincing 
evidence to the effect that the company will pay normal 
tax during the speci˜ed period.
 
Current and deferred tax for the year
 
Current and deferred tax are recognised in the 

consolidated statement of pro˜t and loss, except 
when they relate to items that are recognised in other 
comprehensive income, in which case, the current and 

deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive 
income. 
 
The Group offsets current tax assets and current tax 
liabilities, where it has a legally enforceable right to set 
off the recognised amounts and where it intends either to 
settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the 
liability simultaneously. In case of deferred tax assets and 
deferred tax liabilities, the same are offset if the Group has 
a legally enforceable right to set off corresponding current 
tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred 
tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income 
taxes levied by the same tax authority on the Group.
o)
 
Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent 

Assets and Commitments
 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, 
it is probable that the Group will be required to settle the 
obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligation. 
 
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate 

of the consideration required to settle the present 
obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking 
into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the 
obligations. When a provision is measured using the cash 
˚ow estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying 
amount is the present obligations of those cash ˚ows 
(when the effect of the time value of money is material). 
 
When some or all of the economic bene˜ts required to 
settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a 
third party, a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is 
virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and 
the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.
 
Contingent liabilities and Contingent assets are not 

recognised in the consolidated ˜nancial statements when 
an in˚ow/ out˚ow of economic bene˜ts/ loss are probable.
p)
 
Non-derivative Financial Instruments
 
Financial assets and ˜nancial liabilities are recognised when 

a Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instruments. Financial assets and ˜nancial liabilities are 
initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are 
directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of ˜nancial 
assets and ˜nancial liabilities (other than ˜nancial assets 
and ˜nancial liabilities at fair value through pro˜t or loss) 
are added to or deducted from the fair value measured on 
initial recognition of ˜nancial assets or ˜nancial liabilities, as 
appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly 
attributable to the acquisition of ˜nancial assets or ˜nancial 
liabilities at fair value through pro˜t or loss are recognised 

immediately in the consolidated statement of pro˜t and loss.
 
Financial assets at amortised cost
 
Financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost if these ˜nancial assets are held within a business 
whose objective is to hold these assets in order to collect 

contractual cash ˚ows and the contractual terms of the 
˜nancial asset give rise on speci˜ed dates to cash ˚ows 
that are solely payments of principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding.
 
Financial assets at fair value through pro˜t or loss (FVTPL)
 
Financial assets are measured at fair value through pro˜t 

and loss unless it is measured at amortised cost or at fair 
value through other comprehensive income on initial 
recognition. The transaction costs directly attributable 
to the acquisition of ˜nancial assets and liabilities at fair 
value through pro˜t or loss are immediately recognised in 
consolidated statement of pro˜t and loss.
 
Financial liabilities
 
Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using 

the effective interest method.
127
 
Equity instruments
 
An equity instrument is a contract that evidences residual 
interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its 
liabilities. Equity instruments recognised by the Group are 
measured at the proceeds received net off direct issue cost.
 
Offsetting of ˜nancial instruments
 
Financial assets and ˜nancial liabilities are offset and the 

net amount is reported in ˜nancial statements if there is a 
currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised 
amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to 
realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
q)
 
Derivative ˜nancial instruments
 
The Group enters into a variety of derivative ˜nancial 

instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and 
foreign exchange rate risks, including foreign exchange 
forward contracts/options and interest rate swaps. 
 
The use of foreign currency forward contracts / options is 
governed by the Group™s policies approved by the Board 
of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of 
such ˜nancial derivatives consistent with the Group™s risk 
management strategy. The counter party to the Group™s 
foreign currency forward contracts is generally a bank. 
The Group does not use derivative ˜nancial instruments 
for speculative purposes.
 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the 

date the derivative contracts are entered into and are 
subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end 
of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is 
recognised in the consolidated statement of pro˜t and 
loss immediately.
 
Pro˜t or loss arising on cancellation or renewal of a forward 
exchange contract is recognised as income or as expense 
in the period in which such cancellation or renewal occurs.
r)
 
Impairment
 
Financial assets (other than at fair value)
 
The Group assesses at each Balance sheet whether a 
˜nancial asset or a Group of ˜nancial assets is impaired. 
Ind AS 109 requires expected credit losses to be measured 
through a loss allowance. The Group recognises lifetime 
expected losses for all contract assets and/or all trade 
receivables that do not constitute a ˜nancing transaction. 
For all other ˜nancial assets, expected credit losses are 
measured at an amount equal to the 12 month expected 
credit losses or at an amount equal to the lifetime expected 
credit losses if the credit risk on the ˜nancial asset has 
increased signi˜cantly since initial recognition.
 
Non-˜nancial assets
 
Property, Plant and Equipment and intangible assets
 
At the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews 

the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible 
assets to determine whether there is any indication that 
those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any 

such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the 
asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the 
impairment loss (if any). When it is not possible to estimate 
the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group 
estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating 
unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and 
consistent basis of allocation can be identi˜ed, corporate 
assets are also allocated to individual cash generating 
units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest 
Group of cash generating unit for which a reasonable and 
consistent allocation basis can be identi˜ed.
 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs 
of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, 
the estimated future cash ˚ows are discounted to their 

present value using a pre-tax discount rate that re˚ects 
current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks speci˜c to the asset for which the estimates 
of future cash ˚ows have not been adjusted.
 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating 
unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the 

carrying amount of the asset (or cash generating unit) is 
reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss 
is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement 
pro˜t and loss.
 
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the 
carrying amount of the asset (or a cash generating unit) 
is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable 
amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does 
not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for 
the asset (or cash generating unit) in prior years. A reversal 
of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the 

consolidated statement of pro˜t and loss.
s)
 
Business combinations 
 
At the time of acquisition, the Company considers whether 
each acquisition represents the acquisition of a business 
or the acquisition of an asset. The Company accounts 
for an acquisition as a business combination where an 
integrated set of activities and assets, including property, 
is acquired. More speci˜cally, consideration is given to the 
extent to which signi˜cant processes are acquired and, in 
particular, the extent of services provided by the subsidiary 
(e.g., maintenance, cleaning, security, bookkeeping, hotel 
services, etc.). 
128
 
Business combinations are accounted for using the 
acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured 
as the aggregate of the consideration transferred 
measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of 
any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. 
 
At the acquisition date, the identi˜able assets acquired and 
the liabilities assumed are recognised at their acquisition 
date fair values. For this purpose, the liabilities assumed 
include contingent liabilities representing present 
obligation and they are measured at their acquisition fair 
values irrespective of the fact that out˚ow of resources 
embodying economic bene˜ts is not probable. 
 
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the 

˜nancial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate 
classi˜cation and designation in accordance with the 
contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent 
conditions as at the acquisition date. 
 
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess 
of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and 
the amount recognised for non-controlling interests, and 

any previous interest held, over the net identi˜able assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net 
assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration 
transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly 
identi˜ed all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities 
assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure 
the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date. If 
the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value 
of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration 
transferred, then the gain is recognised in OCI and 
accumulated in equity as capital reserve. However, if 
there is no clear evidence of bargain purchase, the entity 
recognises the gain directly in equity as capital reserve, 

without routing the same through OCI.
 
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less 
any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose 
of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business 
combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each 
of the Group™s cash-generating units that are expected 
to bene˜t from the combination, irrespective of whether 
other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to 
those units. 
 
A cash generating unit to which goodwill has been 
allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more 
frequently when there is an indication that the unit may 
be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash 
generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the 
impairment loss is allocated ˜rst to reduce the carrying 
amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to 
the other assets of the unit pro rata based on the carrying 

amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss for 
goodwill is recognised in pro˜t or loss. An impairment loss 

recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent 
periods.
t)
 
Operating Cycle
 
The Group presents assets and liabilities in the 
consolidated balance sheet based on current / non-

current classi˜cation based on operating cycle. 
 
An asset is treated as current when it is:
 
1.
 
Expected to be realized or intended to be sold or 

consumed in normal operating cycle;
 
2.
 
Held primarily for the purpose of trading;
 
3.
 
Expected to be realized within twelve months after 
the reporting period, or
 
4.
 
Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being 
exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least 
twelve months after the reporting period
 
All other assets are classi˜ed as non-current.
 
A liability is current when:
 
1.
 
It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle;
 
2.
 
It is held primarily for the purpose of trading;
 
3.
 
It is due to be settled within twelve months after the 

reporting period, or
 
4.
 
There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement 

of the liability for at least twelve months after the 
reporting period
 
All other liabilities are classi˜ed as non-current.
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classi˜ed as non-

current assets and liabilities.
 
The Group has identi˜ed twelve months as its operating 
cycle.
u)
 
Segment Reporting
 
Operating segments are de˜ned as components of an 

enterprise for which discrete ˜nancial information is 
available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating 
decision maker, in deciding how to allocate resources 
and assessing performance. The Group™s chief operating 
decision maker is the Managing Director.
 
Segment revenue, segment expenses, segment assets and 
segment liabilities have been identi˜ed to segments on the 
basis of their relationship to the operating activities of the 
segment. Inter segment revenue is accounted on the basis 
129
of transactions which are primarily determined based on 
market / fair value factors. Revenue, expenses, assets and 
liabilities which relate to the Group as a whole and are not 
allocable to segments on a reasonable basis have been 
included under ﬁunallocated revenue / expenses / assets / 
liabilitiesﬂ.
v)
 
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty 
 
The preparation of the consolidated ˜nancial statements 

in conformity with the Ind AS requires management to 
make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect 
the application of accounting policies and the reported 
amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures as at date of 
the consolidated ˜nancial statements and the reported 
amounts of the revenues and expenses for the years 
presented. The estimates and associated assumptions 
are based on historical experience and other factors that 
are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates under different assumptions and 
conditions. The estimates and underlying assumptions are 
reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting 
estimates are recognised in the period in which the 
estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, 

or in the period of the revision and future periods if the 
revision affects both current and future periods.
 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
 
The following are the key assumptions concerning the 

future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at 
the end of the reporting period that may have a signi˜cant 
risk of causing as material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities within next ˜nancial year. 
 
i.
 
Useful lives of property, plant and equipment
  
As described in Note 2(g), the Group reviews the 

estimated useful lives and residual values of property, 
plant and equipment at the end of each reporting 
period. During the current ˜nancial year, the 
management determined that there were no changes 
to the useful lives and residual values of the property, 
plant and equipment. 
 
ii.
 
Provisions and Contingent Liabilities
  
Provisions and Contingent Liabilities are reviewed at 

each Balance Sheet date and adjusted to re˚ect the 
current best estimates.
 
iii.
 
Impairment of Goodwill
  
Goodwill of 
H
 23,456.09 Lacs and 
H
 1,921.97 Lacs 
have been allocated for impairment testing purpose 
to the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) viz., Adhesives 
and Plastics Segment respectively. 
  
The recoverable amount of all cash generating units 
(CGUs) has been determined based on value in 
use calculations. These calculations use cash ˚ow 
projections based on ˜nancial budgets approved by 
management. Recoverable amounts for these CGUs 
has been determined based on value in use for which 
cash ˚ow forecasts of the related CGU™s using a growth 
rate based on company™s projection of business 
and growth of the industry in which the company is 
operating. Discount rate ranging from 12% to 18% has 
been applied. The values assigned to the assumption 
re˚ect past experience and are consistent with the 
management™s plans for focusing operations in these 
markets. The growth rate does not exceed the long term 
average growth rate for the respective business in which 
the CGU operates. The management believes that the 
planned market share growth is reasonably achievable. 
  
An analysis of the sensitivity of the computation 

to a change in key parameters (operating margin, 
discount rate and growth rate), based on a reasonable 
assumptions, did not identify any probable scenario 
in which the recoverable amount of the CGU would 
decrease below its carrying amount.

Before accepting any new customer, the Group assesses the potential customer™s credit quality and de˜nes credit limits by 
customer. Limits attributed to customers are reviewed annually. There are no customers who represent more than 5% of the 

total balance of trade receivable as at March 31, 2019 and as at March 31, 2018. 
3
 
In determining the allowances for credit impaired trade receivables , the Group has used a practical expedient by computing 

the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables based on a provision matrix. The provision matrix takes into account 

historical credit loss experience and is adjusted for forward looking information. The expected credit loss allowance is based on 
the ageing of the receivables that are due and rates used in the provision matrix.

At March 31, 2019,

 2,077.96 Lacs) had been sold to a provider of invoice discounting 
and debt factoring services. The Group is committed to underwrite any of the debts transferred and therefore continues to 

recongnise the debts sold within trade receivables until the debtors repay of default. Since the trade receivables continue to 

be recongnised, the business model of the Group is not affected.

Sensitivity analysis:
 
Signi˜cant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the de˜ned bene˜t obligation are discount rate, expected salary 
increase and mortality. The sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the 
respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant.
 
The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the de˜ned bene˜t obligation as it is 

unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
 
Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the de˜ned bene˜t obligation has been 
calculated using ﬂProjected Unit Creditﬂ method at the end of the reporting period which is the same as that applied in 
calculating the de˜ned bene˜t obligation liability recognised in Balance Sheet.
 
There were no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from prior years.
 
The Group expects to make a contribution of 
H
 494.82 Lacs (as at March 31, 2018: 
H
 255.30 Lacs) to the de˜ned bene˜t plans

instruments:
  
-

i

enters into a variety of derivative ˜nancial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk.
3
 
Financial risk management objectives
       
 
The Group's ˜nancial liabilities comprise mainly of borrowings, trade payables and other ˜nancial liabilities. The Company™s

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
      
  
The Group is mainly exposed to the currency : USD, EUR and AED
  
The following table details,  Group™s sensitivity to a 5% increase and decrease in the rupee against the relevant foreign 
currencies. 5% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and 
represents management™s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. This is mainly attributable 
to the exposure outstanding not hedged on receivables and payables in the Group at the end of the reporting period. The 
sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at 
the period end for a 5% change in foreign currency rate. A positive number below indicates an increase in the pro˜t and 
equity where the rupee strengthens 5% against the relevant currency. For a 5% weakening of the rupee against the relevant 
currency, there would be a comparable impact on the pro˜t and equity, and the balances below would be negative.
  
Impact on pro˜t or loss and total equity
  
The Group, in accordance with its risk management policies and procedures, enters into foreign currency forward contracts 
to manage its exposure in foreign exchange rate variations. The counter party is generally a bank. These contracts are for 
a period between one day and ˜ve years. The above sensitivity dose not include the impact of foreign currency forward 
contracts and option contracts which largely mitigate the risk.
 
ii
 
Interest risk
      
  
Interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash ˚ow with respect to interest payments on borrowing will ˚uctuate because 

of change in market interest rates. The group's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to 
the Group's long-term debt obligation with ˚oating interest rates. 
  
Interest rate sensitivity
      
  
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on that portion of loans 
and borrowings affected. With all other variables held constant, the Group™s pro˜t before tax is affected through the 
impact on ˚oating rate borrowings, as follows:

MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT RISK
      
  
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counter party will default on its contractual obligation resulting in ˜nancial loss to the 

Group. The Group uses its own trading records to evaluate the credit worthiness of its customers. The Group™s exposure 
are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded, are spread amongst approved counter 
parties (Refer note 12 - Trade receivable).

MANAGEMENT OF LIQUIDITY RISK
      
  
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will face in meeting its obligations associated with its ˜nancial liabilities. The 

Group™s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have suf˜cient liquidity to meet its 
liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking 
damage to the Group™s reputation.
  
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has established an 
appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Group™s short-term, medium-term and 
long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate 
reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash ˚ows, and 
by matching the maturity pro˜les of ˜nancial assets and liabilities.
      
  
The following table shows the maturity analysis of the Group™s ˜nancial liabilities based on contractually agreed 

undiscounted cash ˚ows along with its carrying value as at the Balance Sheet date.

˜nancial year ended March 31, 2019. The proposal is subject to the approval of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and 
if approved would result in a cash out˚ow of approximately 
H
 581.22 Lacs, including dividend distribution tax.
44 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT
The below amendments have also became effective for the Group from ˜nancial year beginning April 1, 2018. However, the 
management has evaluated and determined that the adoption of these amendments will not have any material impact on the 
consolidated ˜nancial statements since there are no such transactions or the Group™s existing policies are aligned to these 
amendments:
1.
 
Amendment to Ind AS 12 Income Taxes Œ regarding recognition of deferred tax assets on unrealised losses
2.
 
Applying Appendix B of Ind AS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates
3.
 
Amendment to Ind AS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
4.
 
Amendment to Ind AS 40 Investment Property - regarding transfer of investment property
5.
 
Amendment to Ind AS 112 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities Œ regarding disclosure requirements
163
Standards issued but not yet effective
Ind AS 116 Œ Leases

Ind AS 116 Leases was noti˜ed by MCA on 30 March 2019 and it replaces Ind AS 17 Leases, including appendices thereto. Ind 
AS 116 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 April 2019. Ind AS 116 sets out the principles for the recognition, 
measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases and requires lessees to account for all leases under a single on-balance sheet 
model similar to the accounting for ˜nance leases under Ind AS 17. Lessees will be required to separately recognise the interest 

expense on the lease liability and the depreciation expense on the right-of-use asset. 
The Group intends to adopt these standards from 1 April 2019. As the Group does not have any material leases, therefore the 
adoption of this standard is not likely to have a material impact in its Consolidated Financial Statements.
45 
The ˜gures for the previous year have been regrouped/ reclassi˜ed wherever necessary to con˜rm with the current year™s 
classi˜cation. Moreover, due to merger, ˜gures for the current year is not comparable with the previous year to that extent.
