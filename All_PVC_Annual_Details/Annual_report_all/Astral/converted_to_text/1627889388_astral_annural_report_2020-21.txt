Plastic pipes have many advantages over the metal pipes. 
The raw materials used in manufacturing plastic pipes are 


correlated to crude oil prices. Superior real estate properties 
and low prices have led to the substitution of metal pipes by 
plastic pipes. The increase in the availability of raw materials

The company applies a single recognition and

The company recognises right-of-use assets at the 
commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the 

assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated

An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when 





the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of

Intangible assets are amortised over their estimated

The group assesses at contract inception whether a 
contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract

The group applies a single recognition and measurement 

approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and 

liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets 

representing the right to use the underlying assets.
A.
 

 
The group recognises right-of-use assets at the 

commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the 


assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated 


any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-
of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities 
recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease 

payments made at or before the commencement date 
less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets 
are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter 

of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the 
assets. 
Lease liabilities
 
 
At the commencement date of the lease, the group 
recognises lease liabilities measured at the present 
value of lease payments to be made over the lease term.

In calculating the present value of lease payments,

exemption to its short-term leases (i.e., those leases 

that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the 
commencement date and do not contain a purchase 


recognition exemption to leases that are considered to
