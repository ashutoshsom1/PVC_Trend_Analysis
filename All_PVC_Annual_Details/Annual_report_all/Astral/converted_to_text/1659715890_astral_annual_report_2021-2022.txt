us a strong competitive advantage. We have an in-house marketing team 
to service this extensive network of dealers and distributors. Many of these 

Through the years, our distribution prowess and long-standing relationships 
with our partners have contributed to our market dominance. The company 
has been strong in the West part of the country in the past. In recent years, 
 
the company has improved its position in the south and east with new plants

Creating Possibilities for Progress
Dear Shareholders, 
It gives me immense pleasure to write to you after yet another 
eventful year of progress. We are proud to have continued our 
industry-leading growth momentum through a year that was 
relentless with the unprecedented inflationary pressures, ongoing 
war and supply chain constraints. Also, intermittent COVID-19 
virus outbreaks continued its impact across the globe with various 
disruptions to businesses, and caused social and economic 
upheaval and lockdowns in some parts of the world. 

support services for our employees 
and their families, which include 
critical medical equipment supplies, 

assistance. We also stepped up our 
partnerships with various NGOs, 

support to provide COVID-19 relief.
The year in retrospect
During the year, we achieved the 

This robust performance in a year 
marked with challenges was a result 
of our relentless focus on execution, 
wherein we reinforced our core 
strengths by investing in expanding 
our capacities and distribution 
networks. The year saw surging input 
costs and supply-side constraints. 
However, we mitigated the situation 
by taking a balanced approach of 
price hikes and cost optimisation 
initiatives. Our attempts at widening 
our distribution network also yielded

We progressed on our journey to 

and operationally future-ready. The 
modernisation and de-bottlenecking 
journey continued for existing 
facilities, as we added innovative and 

Adhesives category.
Continuous upheavals 
notwithstanding, we recorded 
strong growth across all our 

and Adhesives business segment 
recording the highest production 
volumes historically. We also made 
impressive progress on the Water 

of doubling our revenues in the same 
in FY23. 
Focusing on the next
In a future-oriented move, our Board, 
in a meeting held on April 29, 2022, 
approved to acquire 51% controlling 
equity stake in the operating paint 

Limited. Strategically, the entry into 
paints gives us the opportunity to 
harness synergies with the existing 
sales and distribution network and 
legacy of the Astral brand, and has the 

all our stakeholders. 
We continue to map our portfolio 
against the dynamic market 
environment to create a portfolio that 
serves as a lever for our ambitions. 
Thus, we have reworked our product 

sanitaryware, transforming us into a 
complete building material player. 
We will leverage our vast and deeply 
entrenched pan-India distribution 
network to drive growth in new 
businesses. Our go-to-market 
strategy will be to gradually scale 


eventually metamorphosing  into a 
pan-India player. We anticipate that 
these two new product categories 
alongwith other newly launched 




a threefold increase in sales from 
our existing levels. Furthermore, 
we have acquired a ready facility on 
asset purchase basis at Jamnagar to 
manufacture faucets. 

In addition to our obligations to 
our customers, we think that social 
and environmental responsibility is 
necessary for long-term success. 
Through a variety of projects, the 
Astral Foundation made considerable 
progress in its objective to serve and 
empower marginalised communities.
In line with our commitment to 
achieving holistic progress, we are 
working continuously to empower 
our people. This year we ensured 
better training and up-skilling of our 
team members as we recorded a 
threefold increase in training man-
hours compared to the previous year. 
We endeavour to make Astral a truly 
enriching workplace with supportive 
policies and appropriate health 
and safety measures. I am happy 
to announce that our commitment 
to employee care and career

2021-22.
We continued to prioritise our ESG 
(environment, social and governance) 

of energy from cleaner sources at our 
facilities remained one of our primary 
focus areas during the year. The year 
also witnessed us consuming the 
highest ever solar units, as we doubled 
our installed solar power capacity 
compared to last year, and now ~ 20% 
of our Santej and Dholka plants™ power 
needs are met by solar energy.
Looking ahead 
Although the economic environment 
remains uncertain, the long-term 
growth opportunities remain 
favourable for us. Over the 
past few years, we have made 
substantial investments to support 
our decentralisation strategy by 
expanding our manufacturing 
capacities. We now believe we 
have reached a point where all 
of our investments will bear fruit 
and accelerate the growth of our 
company.
The past year has been a pivotal one, 
with numerous initiatives undertaken 
which were essential to accelerate the 
growth of our business. As we tread 
new avenues to capitalise on growth 
opportunities and enhance value, we 
impetrate our stakeholders to remain 
as committed to us as they have been 
in the past. We believe in our ability 
to endure the ebbs and flows of the 
business cycle and will continue to 
work to the best of our abilities to 
deliver value.
In closing, I would like to express 
my sincere appreciation to all our 

support. I am certain that we will script 
an exciting growth journey ahead. 
Looking forward to our prosperous 
future at Astral Limited, thank you.

Delivering on Promises
MESSAGE FROM CFO
Dear Shareholders, 
It™s been an incredible year for us at Astral, and I™d like to take 
this opportunity to thank you all and my dear colleagues for 
the unwavering support. We have all endured one of the most 
challenging periods of the pandemic, and I hope that you and 
your families are healthy and safe.
FY22 has bolstered our faith in our business model and strategic 
decisions. The resilience demonstrated by the Company amidst 
the disruptions caused by the pandemic resulted in its best-ever 
performance. This strong performance is a testimony to our 
robust business model and execution capabilities.
Reviewing FY22
In FY22, we witnessed strong growth 
across our business segments and 
we closed the year with a revenue 


Our EBITDA grew by 18.97% to 
 

 



FY21. This performance is remarkable 
given the challenging operating 
environment, which included 
managing supply chain issues, volatile 
raw material prices, and adhering to a 
multitude of COVID-19 constraints.
We maintained healthy liquidity 
to meet operational and strategic 
objectives. Despite the strong 
revenue growth, we ensured to keep 
our working capital cycle in check.  
As a result, the net working capital 
days decreased from 27 in FY21 to 
21 in FY22. Despite holding higher 
inventory throughout the year to 
alleviate supply-side challenges, we 
optimised our working capital cycle 
by reducing our debtor days to 22 
in FY22, as against 32 in FY21.  As of 
March 31, 2022, our net cash balance 

million as of March 31, 2021.

pipes business performed extremely 
well during the year. EBITDA for 

EBITDA margin of 19.20%. The strong 
performance was driven by a mix of 
volume and realisation growth along 

across geographies. The adhesives 
business recorded a strong top line 
growth of 37.39% reaching 
 

 


EBITDA margin of 12.80%.  
Inflationary pressures began building 
up in FY21 and largely persisted 
through FY22. As a result, prices of 
our key inputs touched all-time highs 

the interim. While most of the inflation 
was passed on to the end-user with 
a lag, we took a tactical call to face 

strengthen our competitiveness and 
aggressively pursue market share. 
This is reflected in the year-on-year 
decline in the operating margin. 
However, it was still better compared 
to the industry margins.
Delivering on our promises
We have always upheld our 
commitment to increasing value 
for our stakeholders. Despite 
the challenging environment, 
we remained steadfast in our 

million in top-line from our adhesives 
business and attained double-digit 
growth in our pipes business, as 
promised to our shareholders.

our growth objectives. The existing 
facility™s 36,000 KL capacity can 
accommodate a threefold increase 
in volume without additional capital 
expenditures.  In addition, we intend 
to leverage our existing dealer and 
distribution network to drive the 
growth in this segment. 
Beginning June 2022, the Company 
also started marketing faucets and 
sanitary ware under the brand name 
Astral. The Company will operate 
in the premium economy segment 
in this product category and will

GLOBAL ECONOMY 
The global economy experienced erratic trends during the 
year gone by. After the initial COVID-19 wave, economic 
activity rebounded strongly in 2021, aided by pent-up 
demand and unprecedented policy support. However, two 
successive waves of COVID-19, prolonged labour market 
issues, and ongoing global supply chain bottlenecks 
have diminished the likelihood of widespread economic

However, the Russia-Ukraine conflicts have hampered 
global growth prospects and exerted inflationary pressure, 

exports and a wide variety of metals, food staples, and 
agricultural inputs. Assuming inflation expectations remain 
stable, inflation should steadily decline as supply-demand 
imbalances diminish, and monetary policy in the world™s 
leading nations responds. As long-term asset purchases 
are anticipated to slow, monetary policy is anticipated to 
tighten in advanced countries progressively. In emerging

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
Plastic Pipes 
Demand for building materials such as paint, sanitaryware 
and faucets, ceramic, plywood, and laminates is correlated 

portion of pipe demand comes from irrigation, urban 
infrastructure, and sanitation projects, allowing for faster 
growth than in other building material sectors. Because of 
increased end-use sector investments such as irrigation 
and WSS, the plastic pipes industry has historically grown 

adoption, and replacement of metal pipes with plastic 
pipes have also aided growth.
The market for plastic pipes is valued at approximately 

approximately 65% of the market. 50-55% of the industry™s 
demand is accounted for by plumbing pipes used in 
residential and commercial real estate, 35% by agriculture, 
and 5-10% by infrastructure and industrial projects.

component for transporting and distributing water, oil, 
gas and other commodities. As a result, plastic pipes are 
being rapidly installed in a vast array of applications, such 
as irrigation, domestic plumbing, sewerage, and industrial 
applications. Depending on the application, plastic pipes, 
galvanised iron pipes, cement pipes, ERW pipes, and other 
materials are utilised. However, plastic pipes are gaining 
popularity and have become the material of choice due to 
the easy availability of raw materials, ease of use, lightweight, 
ease of installation, longer shelf life, and lower cost.
PVC PIPES:

Due to the government™s emphasis on cleanliness and 

substitution demand, the domestic plastic pipes market 
grew at a CAGR of 10 to 12% between FY15 and FY20. 
Demand is anticipated to expand at a CAGR of 12 to 14% 
between FY21 and FY25, driven by increased investment in 
WSS projects, the substitution of metal pipes with polymer 
pipes, and replacement demand.

for regional players™ domination in this category is the 
product™s voluminous nature, which adds high freight costs

regulation on wastewater, and ageing water infrastructure, 
demand for plastic storage tanks is expected to remain

(26 to 28 % of revenue). 

the irrigation and building construction industries to join 

SBR (styrene butadiene rubber) is used in foam and 
mattress applications as a sprayable adhesive. Chloroprene 
rubber is used in a variety of applications ranging from 
woodworking to leather to foam applications, accounting 
for 12-14 percent of the market.
Epoxy adhesives dominate among reactive adhesives (15-
17% ). These are also utilised in the furniture, woodworking, 

well as their durability. Cyanoacrylates are used to connect 
polymers, metals, and rubbers. Silicone sealants account 
for 12 to 14% of the consumer adhesives market. Due to 
their water-resistance, they are commonly used for basic 
domestic repairs particularly around sinks and pipes.
DEMAND DRIVERS
Rising demand for wooden furniture 
The furniture industry in India uses a variety of adhesives, 

epoxy. The market is anticipated to be driven by a number 
of variables, including increasing urbanisation, a growing 
preference for more modular and compact furniture, and 
a rising need for durable and hybrid furniture. In the near 
future, all of these variables are anticipated to contribute to 
the growth of the furniture industry, and by extension, the 
consumer adhesives sector as well. According to a CRISIL 
report,  the demand for wooden furniture is expected to 

Increasing demand for non-hazardous, green and 
sustainable adhesives 
As consumers become increasingly conscious of the 
negative impacts of petroleum-based products, the 
demand for bio-based / eco-friendly adhesives such as 
starch and lignin is rapidly increasing. Consequently, 
manufacturers are heavily investing in the research and 
development of such adhesives. As green and sustainable 
alternatives to solvent-based adhesives, hybrid adhesives 
are widely being used by adhesive end-user sectors. This 
growth is expected to further rise, as more consumers 
become aware of environmental degradation. 
Increased spending on building construction 
Adhesives and sealants are used in a variety of applications 
in the construction sector, including flooring and carpets, 


window frames, among others. In a renewed push to the 
sector, under the Atmanirbhar Bharat programme, the 
government has introduced multiple policies to boost the 

Rental Housing Complex (ARHC) schemes, which also 
includes Housing for All and other investments in the 
industrial segment. As a result , the investments in the 
construction sector are expected to grow at a CAGR of 
4-6% over the medium term.
Increasing demand for electronics
Adhesives are used in a variety of applications in the 
electronics sector, including conformal coatings, terminal 
electrode protection and surface mount device bonding, 
among others. According to the Ministry of Electronics and 
IT, the electronics industry is one of the fastest-growing in 

The industry is expected to grow at a robust pace of 
 
19-24% over the medium term.
OUTLOOK
The consumer adhesives market in India is expected to 
grow at a 9-10% CAGR between FY21 and FY26, owing 
to economic recovery and growth in end-user sectors. 
Demand, in particular, is likely to recover as the Indian 
economy recovers from the pandemic™s impact. Overall, 
the consumer adhesives business is estimated to grow at an 
8% CAGR between FY22 and FY26.
MARKET WISE SPLIT OF ADHESIVES


grew at a CAGR of 8-10% between 2015 and 2020, 
propelled by the rapidly expanding furniture business 
and rising income levels, which led to a rise in interiors 
demand. In addition, enhanced building construction 
investment also contributed to the growth. However, due 
to the pandemic-induced decline in construction activity, 
the market did contract in FY21. However, the decline was 
mitigated by increasing demand from the furniture market 
due to work from home, which increased demand for home 
furnishings.

BUSINESS PERFORMANCE 
 
& FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
The pipes business fared remarkably well through the year, 


The strong result was driven by a combination of volume, 
realisation growth, and geographically diverse demand.  
The adhesives business grew its revenue by 37.39% in

once it matures in a few years.
On a consolidated basis, the Company recorded strong 
growth in our business and closed the year with a revenue 


 

 

million in FY21.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a) Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements 


Standards) Rules, 2015, and relevant amendment rules issued 
thereafter read with Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, 
as amended and presentation requirements of Division II of 
Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013, (Ind AS compliant 
Schedule III). All accounting policies are consistently applied; 









Million have been reported as ﬁ0ﬂ.
Fair value: 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset 
or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date, regardless of 
whether that price is directly observable or estimated using 
another valuation technique.
The fair value measurement is based on the presumption 
that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability 
takes place either:
-
 
In the principal market for the asset or liabilities or
-
 
In the absence of a principal market in the most 
advantageous market for the asset and liabilities. 
In estimating the fair value of an asset or liability, the Company 
takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability 
if market participants would take those characteristics into 
account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement 
date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes 


the scope of Ind AS 102 Share-based Payment, leasing 
transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 116 Leases, and 
measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are 
not fair valued such as net realizable value in Ind AS 2 or value 
in use in Ind AS 36 Impairment of assets.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured 

within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based 

measurement as a whole:
1)
 
Level 1 Š Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities.
2)
 
Level 2 Š Valuation techniques for which the lowest level 

directly or indirectly observable.
3)
 
Level 3 Š Valuation techniques for which the lowest level 

 
is unobservable.
b) Use of Estimates

with the Ind AS which requires the management to make 

reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and 

estimates and assumptions are based on management™s 
evaluation of relevant facts and circumstances as on the date 

these estimates.
106
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. Revisions to the accounting estimates are 
recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised 

c) Inventories
Inventories are stated at lower of cost and net realizable 
value after providing for obsolescence and other losses, 
where considered necessary. Cost includes cost of purchase 

their present location and condition. Raw materials, Stock 
in Trade, Stores, Spares and Packing materials are valued 

goods include appropriate proportion of overheads. 

for inventories less all estimated costs of completion and 
costs necessary to make the sale.
d) Cash and cash equivalents


convertible into known amounts of cash that are subject to 

maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase.
e) Revenue from contract with customer
Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised 
when control of the goods or services are transferred to the 
customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to 

those goods or services. 
Sale of goods
Revenue from sale of goods is recognised at the point in time 
when control of the asset is transferred to the customer. In 
determining the transaction price for the sale of goods, the 

 
 if any.
Variable consideration 
If the consideration in a contract includes a variable amount, 
the Company estimates the amount of consideration to 

to the customer. The variable consideration is estimated 
at contract inception and constrained until it is highly 

of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the 
associated uncertainty with the variable consideration is 
subsequently resolved. 
Trade receivables (Contract balances)
A receivable represents the Company™s right to an amount 
of consideration that is unconditional (i.e., only the passage 
of time is required before payment of the consideration
 
is due). 
Interest Income


and the amount of income can be measured reliably. Interest 

Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to 
the principal outstanding and the interest rate applicable, 


that asset™s net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Insurance claims

uncertainty in receiving the claims.
f) Property, plant and equipment

less accumulated depreciation and net of impairment. 
The actual cost capitalised includes material cost, 


 
installation stage.
 Properties in course of construction for production, supply 
or administration purposes are carried at cost, less any 


incurred during the period of implementation of a project, 
till it is commissioned, is accounted as Capital work in 

appropriate categories of property, plant and equipment 
when completed and ready for intended use.
All items of property, plant and equipment is derecognised 


gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item 
of property, plant and equipment is determined as the 

amount of the asset and is recognised in the statement of 

Depreciation 
Depreciable amount for assets is the cost of an asset, or 
other amount substituted for cost, less its estimated residual 
value. Depreciation on Property, Plant and Equipment other 
than land and properties under construction are charged 
based on straight line method on an estimated useful life as 
prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013. 
The estimated useful lives and residual values of the property, 
plant and equipment are reviewed at the end of each 

accounted for on a prospective basis.
Depreciation on items of property, plant and equipment 

rata basis with reference to the date of addition / disposal.
107
g) Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately

separately are carried at cost less accumulated amortization 
and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is 
recognised on a straight-line basis over their estimated 
useful lives. The estimated useful life are reviewed at the end 

estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. 
Derecognition of intangible assets
An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when 

disposal. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an 

net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, 

asset is derecognised.
Useful lives of intangible assets
Intangible assets are Amortised over their estimated useful life 

Brand which is amortised over 7 years since in the opinion of the 

h) Leases 
The company assesses at contract inception whether a 
contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys 


Company as a lessee
The company applies a single recognition and measurement 

leases of low-value assets. The company recognises lease 
liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets 
representing the right to use the underlying assets.
1. Right-of-use assets
The company recognises right-of-use assets at the 
commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the 
underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are 
measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement 
of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes 
the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct 
costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the 
commencement date less any lease incentives received. 
Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis 
over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful 
lives of the assets. 
2. Lease liabilities 
At the commencement date of the lease, the company 
recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of 
lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease 

payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease 




payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease 



to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or 
condition that triggers the payment occurs.
In calculating the present value of lease payments, the 
company uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease 
commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the 
lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement 
date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the 
accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments 
made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities 

lease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to 

used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the 
assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset.

3. Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
The company applies the short-term lease recognition 

a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement 
date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies 

that are considered to be low value. Lease payments on short-
term leases and leases of low value assets are recognised as

loss due to its operating nature. Initial direct costs incurred 
in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added 
to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised 
over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. 
Contingent rents are recognized as other income in the 
period in which they are earned.
i) Government grants 
Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable 
assurance that the grant will be received, and all attached 
conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates to 

basis over the periods that the related costs, for which it is 

relates to an asset, it is reduced from the carrying amount of 
the asset.
j) Foreign Currencies

transactions in currencies other than the entity™s functional 

prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of 
each reporting period, monetary items denominated in 
foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate prevailing at

state insurance scheme, gratuity fund and compensated 
absences. 
De˜ned Contribution Plan: 
The Company™s contribution to Provident Fund is considered 

based on the amount of contribution required to be made 
and when services are rendered by the employees.
De˜ned bene˜t plans:


Unit Credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried 
out at each balance sheet date. Remeasurement, comprising 


immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit 
recognised in other comprehensive income in the period 
in which they occur. Remeasurement recognised in other 
comprehensive income is reflected immediately in retained 



The Company recognizes the following changes in the net 


1) Service costs comprising past and current service costs, 
gains and losses on curtailments and settlements; and
2) Net interest expense or income


obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, 
as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset 
resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, 
plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in 
future contributions to the schemes.
Short-term employee bene˜ts:


by employees are recognised during the year when the 


twelve months after the end of the period in which the 
employee renders the related service.
Long-term employee bene˜ts:

within twelve months after the end of the period in which 
the employee renders the related service are recognised as 
a liability at the present value of the estimated future cash 

services provided by employees up to the balance sheet date. 
The Company determines the liability for such accumulated 
leaves using the Projected Unit Credit Method with actuarial 
valuations being carried out at each Balance Sheet date.
Share based payment:
Employees of the Company receive remuneration in the 
form of share-based payments, whereby employees render 
services as consideration for equity instruments (equity-
settled transactions). Equity settled share based payments 
to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity 
instruments at the grant date. The fair value determined at 
the grant date of the equity settled share based payments 

based on the Company™s estimate of equity instruments that 
will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity. 
l) Borrowing costs
Borrowing cost includes interest, Amortisation of ancillary 
costs incurred in connection with arrangement of borrowings 


to the interest cost.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of qualifying assets, which are 
assets that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to 
get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost 
of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially 
ready for their intended use or sale.
Capitalization of borrowing cost is suspended and charged 

period when active development on the qualifying asset 
 
is interrupted. 
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the statement of 

m) Earnings per share

(loss) for the year attributable to equity shareholders by the 
weighted average number of equity shares outstanding 
109
during the year. Diluted earnings per share is computed by 

shareholders by the weighted average number of equity 
shares considered for deriving basic earnings per share and 
the weighted average number of equity shares which could 
have been issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential 
equity shares. 
Potential equity shares are deemed to be dilutive only 
if their conversion to equity shares would decrease the 

Potential dilutive equity shares are deemed to be converted 
as at the beginning of the period, unless they have been 
issued at a later date. The dilutive potential equity shares 
are adjusted for the proceeds receivable had the shares 
been actually issued at fair value (i.e. average market value 
of the outstanding shares). Dilutive potential equity shares 
are determined independently for each period presented.

o) Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent 
Assets and Commitments
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, 
it is probable that the Company will be required to settle 
the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligation. 
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate 
of the consideration required to settle the present obligation 
at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the 
risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligations. When a 
provision is measured using the cash flow estimated to settle 
the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present

amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the

of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present 

market assessments of the time value of money and the risks

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating 
unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the 
carrying amount of the asset (or cash generating unit) is 
reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is 

When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying 
amount of the asset (or a cash generating unit) is increased 
to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that 

amount that would have been determined had no impairment 
loss been recognised for the asset (or cash generating unit) 
in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised 

t) Business combinations 
Business combinations are accounted for using the 
acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured 
as the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured 
at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-
controlling interests in the acquiree. For each business 
combination, the Company elects whether to measure the 
non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the 



the liabilities assumed are recognised at their acquisition date 
fair values. For this purpose, the liabilities assumed include 
contingent liabilities representing present obligation and 
they are measured at their acquisition fair values irrespective 
of the fact that outflow of resources embodying economic 

liabilities acquired in a business combination are measured 
at the basis indicated below:

or arise as a result of the acquisition are accounted in 
accordance with Ind AS 12.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, any 
previously held equity interest is re-measured at its 
acquisition date fair value and any resulting gain or loss is 


aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount 
recognised for non-controlling interests, and any previous 

liabilities assumed. 
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less 
any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose 
of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business 
combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each 


assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. 
A cash generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated 
is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when 
there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the

If the initial accounting for a business combination is 
incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which 
the combination occurs, the Company reports provisional 
amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. 
Those provisional amounts are adjusted through goodwill 
during the measurement period, or additional assets or 
liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained 


recognized at that date. These adjustments are called as 
measurement period adjustments. The measurement period

v) Critical accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty

with the Ind AS requires management to make judgements, 

accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, 


for the years presented. The estimates and associated 

factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results 

and conditions. The estimates and underlying assumptions 
are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting 
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate

Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
The following are the key assumptions concerning the 
future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the

i. Useful lives of property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets

estimated useful lives and residual values, if any, of property, 
plant and equipment and intangible assets at the end of 

management determined that there were no changes to 
the useful lives and residual values of the property plant and 
equipment and intangible assets. 
ii. Provisions and Contingent Liabilities
Provisions and Contingent Liabilities are reviewed at each 
Balance Sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best 
estimates.
iii. Impairment of Investment in Subsidiaries and Joint 
Venture 
The investment in subsidiaries and joint venture are tested 
for impairment in accordance with provisions applicable 

of recoverable amounts of the Company™s investments in 

related information and estimates are used to determine 
the recoverable amount. Key assumptions on which 
management has based its determination of recoverable 
amount includes weighted average cost of capital and 
estimated operating margins.
 Basis the above determination of recoverable amount, the 
management has concluded that provision is required to 

 19 Million for 
advances given for purchase of non-current investments 
in joint venture. During the previous year company made 
impairment provision of 
 123 Million in investments of joint 
venture. 
iv. Impairment of goodwill
With respect to the Goodwill of 
192 Million, the recoverable 
amount of cash generating units (CGU) has been determined 
based on value in use calculations. Recoverable amounts for 
these CGUs has been determined based on value in use for 
which cash flow forecasts of the related CGU and discount 


are consistent with the management™s plans for focusing 
operations in these markets. The management believes that 
the planned market share growth is reasonably achievable.
An analysis of the sensitivity of the computation to a change in 
key parameters (operating margin, discount rate and growth 
rate), based on a reasonable assumption, did not identify any 
probable scenario in which the recoverable amount of the 
CGU would decrease below its carrying amount.

Notes forming part of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
For the year ended March 31, 2022
1. GROUP™S BACKGROUND:

statements of Astral Limited (ﬁthe Parentﬂ or ﬁthe Companyﬂ 
or ‚™Holding Companyﬂ) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the 
Group) for the year ended March 31, 2022.
The Parent is a public company domiciled in India and 
is incorporated under the provision of Companies Act 
applicable in India. Its shares are listed in two recognized 


1996, with the aim to manufacture pro-India plumbing and 
drainage systems in the country. Astral Limited is equipped 



Plumbing systems, Drainage systems, Agriculture, Industrial, 
Electrical Conduit Pipes and water tanks with all kinds of 


issue by the board of directors on May 27, 2022.
 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
a) Basis of Preparation of Consolidated Financial 
Statements 


(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, and relevant 
amendment rules issued thereafter read with Section 133 
of the Companies Act, 2013, as amended and presentation 
requirements of Division II of Schedule III to the Companies 
Act, 2013, (Ind AS compliant Schedule III). All accounting 






information in respect of the previous period. The 


Holding Company, and all values are rounded to the nearest 


b) Fair value: 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset 
or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date, regardless of 
whether that price is directly observable or estimated using 
another valuation technique.
The fair value measurement is based on the presumption 
that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability 
takes place either:
-
 
In the principal market for the asset or liabilities or
-
 
In the absence of a principal market in the most 
advantageous market for the asset and liabilities. 
In estimating the fair value of an asset or liability, the Group 
takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability 
if market participants would take those characteristics into 
account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement 
date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes 


that are within the scope of Ind AS 102 Share-based Payment, 
leasing transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 116 
Leases, and measurements that have some similarities to fair 
value but are not fair valued such as net realizable value in Ind 
AS 2 or value in use in Ind AS 36 Impairment of assets.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured 

categorized within the fair value hierarchy, described as 

the fair value measurement as a whole:
1)
 
Level 1 Š Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active 
markets for identical assets or Liabilities.
2)
 
Level 2 Š Valuation techniques for which the lowest level 

directly or indirectly observable.
3)
 
Level 3 Š Valuation techniques for which the lowest level 

 
is unobservable.
c) Basis of Consolidation 


being the entities controlled by the Company. Control is 
achieved when the Company:
Ł
 
has power over the investee

involvement with the investee; and

The Company considers all relevant facts and circumstances 
in assessing whether or not the Company™s voting rights in an 

Ł
 
The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders 
of the investee;
Ł
 
the size of the Company™s holding of voting rights relative 
to the size and dispersion of holdings ofthe other vote 
holders;
Ł
 
potential voting rights held by the Company, other vote 
holders or other parties;
Ł
 
rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee 
if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to 
one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation 
of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over 
the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control 

of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are

events in similar circumstances. If a member of the Group 
uses accounting policies other than those adopted in the 

events in similar circumstances, appropriate adjustments

of consolidation are drawn up to same reporting date as that 
of the parent company, i.e., year ended on 31 March. 
Consolidation procedure:
Ł
 
Combine like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income, 


the subsidiary are based on the amounts of the assets 

statements at the acquisition date.
Ł
 
Eliminate the carrying amount of the parent™s investment 
in each subsidiary and the parent™s portion of equity of 

how to account for any related goodwill.

income (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the 
parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests, 
even if this results in the non-controlling interests 


bring their accounting policies into line with the Group™s 
 
accounting policies. 
d) Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the 
acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured 
as the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured 
at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-
controlling interests in the acquiree. For each business 
combination, the Group elects whether to measure the non-
controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the 



the liabilities assumed are recognised at their acquisition date 
fair values. For this purpose, the liabilities assumed include 
contingent liabilities representing present obligation and 
they are measured at their acquisition fair values irrespective 
of the fact that outflow of resources embodying economic 

liabilities acquired in a business combination are measured 
at the basis indicated below:


recognised and measured in accordance with Ind AS 12 



or arise as a result of the acquisition are accounted in 
accordance with Ind AS 12.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, any 
previously held equity interest is re-measured at its 
acquisition date fair value and any resulting gain or loss is 

159

aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount 
recognised for non-controlling interests, and any previous 

liabilities assumed. 
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less 
any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose 
of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business 
combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each 


other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to 
 
those units. 
A cash generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated 
is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when 
there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the 
recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than 

to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated 
to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata 
based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any 

An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed 
in subsequent periods unless (a) the impairment loss was 



If the initial accounting for a business combination is 
incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the 
combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts 
for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those 
provisional amounts are adjusted through goodwill during 
the measurement period, or additional assets or liabilities are 
recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts 


date. These adjustments are called as measurement period 

year from the acquisition date.
e) Investment in Joint Venture
A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties 
that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to 

contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, 

require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
The results and assets and liabilities of joint venture are 

using the equity method of accounting.. Under equity 
method, an investment in a joint venture is initially 
recognised in the consolidated balance sheet at cost and 
adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group™s share of the 

venture. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted 
to recognise changes in the Group™s share of net assets of 
the joint venture since the acquisition date. Goodwill relating 
to the joint venture is included in the carrying amount of 
the investment and is not tested for impairment separately. 

the Group™s interest in that joint venture (which includes any 
long term interest that, in substance, form part of Group™s 
net investment in the joint venture), the Group discontinues 
recognizing its share of further losses. Additional losses are 

legal or constructive obligations or made payments on 
behalf of the joint venture.
After application of the equity method, the Group determines 
whether it is necessary to recognise an impairment loss on 
its investment in its joint venture. At each reporting date, the 
Group determines whether there is objective evidence that 
the investment in the joint venture is impaired. If there is such 
evidence, the Group calculates the amount of impairment 

associate or joint venture and its carrying value, and then 



that the recoverable amount of the investment subsequently 
increases.
When a Group entity transacts with a joint venture of the 

the joint venture are recognised in the Group™s consolidated 

venture that are not related to the Group.
When necessary, adjustments are made to bring the 
accounting policies in line with those of the Group. The 






joint venture and that of the Company is of three months. 

the ends of the reporting periods are same from period to 
period. 
f) Inventories
Inventories are stated at lower of cost and net realizable 
value after providing for obsolescence and other losses, 
where considered necessary. Cost includes cost of purchase 

their present location and condition. Raw materials, Stock 
in Trade, Stores, Spares and Packing materials are valued 

goods include appropriate proportion of overheads. 

for inventories less all estimated costs of completion and 
costs necessary to make the sale.
160
g) Cash and cash equivalents


readily convertible into known amounts of cash that are 

original maturities of three months or less from the date 
 
of purchase.
 h) Revenue from contract with customer
Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised 
when control of the goods or services are transferred to 
the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration 

those goods or services. 
Sale of goods
Revenue from sale of goods is recognised at the point in time 
when control of the asset is transferred to the customer. In 
determining the transaction price for the sale of goods, the 

Variable consideration 
If the consideration in a contract includes a variable amount, 
the Group estimates the amount of consideration to which it 

customer. The variable consideration is estimated at contract 
inception and constrained until it is highly probable that a 

revenue recognised will not occur when the associated 
uncertainty with the variable consideration is subsequently 
resolved. 
Trade receivables (Contract balances)
A receivable represents the Group™s right to an amount of 
consideration that is unconditional (i.e., only the passage 
of time is required before payment of the consideration 
 
is due).
Interest Income


and the amount of income can be measured reliably. Interest 

Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to 
the principal outstanding and the interest rate applicable, 


that asset™s net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Insurance claims

uncertainty in receiving the claims.
i) Property, plant and equipment
Property, Plant and Equipment are stated at actual cost 
less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, 
if any. The actual cost capitalised includes material cost, 


 
installation stage.
Properties in the course of construction for production, 
supply or administration purposes are carried at cost, less 


incurred during the period of implementation of a project, 
till it is commissioned, is accounted as Capital work in 

appropriate categories of property, plant and equipment 
when completed and ready for intended use.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised 


gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item 
of property, plant and equipment is determined as the 

amount of the asset and is recognised in the consolidated 

Depreciation
Depreciable amount for assets is the cost of an asset, or other 
amount substituted for cost, less its estimated residual value. 
Depreciation on Property, Plant and Equipment are charged 
based on straight line method on an estimated useful life as 
prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013.
The estimated useful lives and residual values of the property, 
plant and equipment are reviewed at the end of each 

accounted for on a prospective basis. 
Depreciation on items of property, plant and equipment 

rata basis with reference to the date of addition / disposal.
j) Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately

separately are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Amortisation 
is recognised on a straight-line basis over their estimated 
useful lives. The estimated useful life is reviewed at the end 

estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. 
Derecognition of intangible assets
An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when 

disposal. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an 

net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, 

loss when the asset is de-recognised.
161
Useful lives of intangible assets
Intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful 

assets like Brand which is amortised over 7 years since in the 

that period. 
k) Leases
The group assesses at contract inception whether a contract 
is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the 


Group as a lessee
The group applies a single recognition and measurement 

leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises lease 
liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets 
representing the right to use the underlying assets.
Right-of-use assets
The group recognises right-of-use assets at the 
commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the 
underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are 
measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement 
of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes 
the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct 
costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the 
commencement date less any lease incentives received. 
Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis 
over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful 
lives of the assets. 
Lease liabilities 
At the commencement date of the lease, the group 
recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of 
lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease 




guarantees. Variable lease payments that do not depend on 

are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which 
the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.
In calculating the present value of lease payments, the 
Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease 
commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the 
lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement 
date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the 
accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments 
made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is 

term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to 

used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the 
assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset.
Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets

to its short-term leases (i.e., those leases that have a lease 
term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and 
do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease 

are considered to be low value. Lease payments on short-
term leases and leases of low value assets are recognised as 

Group as a lessor
Leases in which the company does not transfer substantially 
all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset 

accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms 

due to its operating nature. Initial direct costs incurred in 
negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added 
to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised 
over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. 
Contingent rents are recognized as revenue in the period in 
which they are earned.
l) Government grants
Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable 
assurance that the grant will be received, and all attached 
conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates to an 

over the periods that the related costs, for which it is intended 

asset, it is reduced from the carrying amount of the asset.
m) Foreign Currencies

end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated 
in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate prevailing at

leaves using the Projected Unit Credit Method with actuarial 
valuations being carried out at each Balance Sheet date.
Share based payment:
Employees of the Group receive remuneration in the form 
of share-based payments, whereby employees render 
services as consideration for equity instruments (equity-
settled transactions). Equity settled share-based payments 
to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity 
instruments at the grant date. The fair value determined at 
the grant date of the equity settled share-based payments 

based on the Group™s estimate of equity instruments that 
will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity. 

additional share dilution in the computation of diluted 
earnings per share.
o) Borrowing costs
Borrowing cost includes interest, amortisation of ancillary 
costs incurred in connection with the arrangement of 


adjustment to the interest cost.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of qualifying assets, which are 
assets that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to 
get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost 
of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially 
ready for their intended use or sale.
Capitalisation of borrowing cost is suspended and charged to 

active development of the qualifying asset is interrupted.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the consolidated 

incurred.
p) Earnings per share

/ (loss) for the year attributable to equity shareholders by 
the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding 
during the year. Diluted earnings per share is computed by 

shareholders by the weighted average number of equity 
163
shares considered for deriving basic earnings per share and 
the weighted average number of equity shares which could 
have been issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential 
equity shares. 
Potential equity shares are deemed to be dilutive only if their 

per share from continuing ordinary operations. Potential 
dilutive equity shares are deemed to be converted as at the 
beginning of the period, unless they have been issued at a 
later date. The dilutive potential equity shares are adjusted for 
the proceeds receivable had the shares been actually issued 
at fair value (i.e. average market value of the outstanding 
shares). Dilutive potential equity shares are determined 
independently for each period presented.

r) Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent 
Assets and Commitments
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, 
it is probable that the Group will be required to settle the 
obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligation. 
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate 
of the consideration required to settle the present obligation 
at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the 
risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligations. When a 
provision is measured using the cash flow estimated to settle 
the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present

that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the 
receivable can be measured reliably.

forward contracts/options and interest rate swaps. 
The use of foreign currency forward contracts / options is 
governed by the Group™s policies approved by the Board 
of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of

foreign currency forward contracts is generally a bank. The

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the 
derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting 
period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the 



the period in which such cancellation or renewal occurs. 
u) Impairment
Financial assets (other than at fair value)




losses for all contract assets and/or all trade receivables 





since initial recognition.
Non-˜nancial assets
Property, Plant and Equipment and intangible assets
At the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews the 
carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to 
determine whether there is any indication that those assets 



any). When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable 
amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the 
recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which 
the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis

allocated to individual cash generating units, or otherwise 
they are allocated to the smallest Group of cash generating 
unit for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis 

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs 
of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present 

market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 

flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating 
unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the 
carrying amount of the asset (or cash generating unit) is 
reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is 

and loss.
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the 
carrying amount of the asset (or a cash generating unit) is 
increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, 

the carrying amount that would have been determined had 
no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash 
generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment 
loss is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement 

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired 
in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, 
allocated to each of the Group™s cash-generating units that

 192 million (Previous year: 192 million) have been allocated 
for impairment testing purpose to the Cash Generating Unit 
(CGU) viz., Adhesives and Plastics Segment respectively. 
The recoverable amount of all cash generating units (CGUs) 
has been determined based on value in use calculations. 
These calculations use cash flow projections based on 

amounts for these CGUs has been determined based on 
value in use for which cash flow forecasts of the related

applied. The values assigned to the assumption reflect past 

plans for focusing operations in these markets. The growth

management believes that the planned market share growth 
is reasonably achievable. 
An analysis of the sensitivity of the computation to a change in 
key parameters (operating margin, discount rate and growth 
rate), based on a reasonable assumptions, did not identify any 
probable scenario in which the recoverable amount of the 
CGU would decrease below its carrying amount.
