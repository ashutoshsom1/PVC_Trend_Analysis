Over the past two decades, Astral has established itself as one of India™s dominant 
brands in the plastic piping segment with diverse end-user applications. Incorporated in 

1996, the Company is steadily progressing in the adhesive segment and infrastructure 

products as well.
Astral has been a pioneer in introducing Chlorinated Polyvinyl Chloride (CPVC)  pipes  


and adhesives categories to meet the dynamic needs of the real estate sector and 

millions of Indian households. With 12 strategically-located manufacturing facilities 

in India and overseas, Astral is counted for bringing the most innovative piping and 

adhesive products with unmatched quality.
Underpinned by its entrenched market presence and wide geographical footprint, Astral 
today is an integrated CPVC player with robust capacity and execution prowess. The 

Company has strengthened its product portfolio by acquiring Rex Polyextrusion Private 

Limited (REPL) a couple of years back. The expanded product suit enables the Company 

to offer newer products in the infrastructure segment with varied applications. With 

strong focus on promotion, the Company has continuously increased its brand visibility 

and customer penetration across the country.

Dear 
S
hareholders,
W
e are indeed living through unusual times. Countries 
across the globe continue to face multitude of challenges 
in the form of Covid-19 health crisis that contributed to an 

economic slowdown. The Government of India intervened 

by taking prompt measures to contain the spread of the 

virus and boost demand.
At Astral, we responded to these headwinds by being 
well-prepared through our strong core competencies 

and resilient business model. The Company implemented 

adequate steps to protect employees and its immediate 

communities. Though we faced temporary disruption in 

our manufacturing operations, our robust IT infrastructure 

ensured uninterrupted services for our customers by 

enabling seamless ‚work from home™ facility.

 The piping segment recorded a

 20,428 million with sales volume of 132,200 

metric tons. The consolidated EBITDA margin and PAT 

margin stood at 17.59% and 9.68%, respectively, during 

the year under review. The anti-dumping duty imposed on 

CPVC resin proved to be an opportunity for the Company 

to gain market share, as one of the leading organised 

industry players.
Our state-of-the art manufacturing units and distribution 
channels across the country enabled us to timely deliver 

products to our customers despite the nationwide 

lockdown. We expect our new piping plant in Odisha 

to be ready by F

 which will help us expand in the 
North-East markets. Moreover, we acquired additional 

land measuring 157,648 sq. meter, adjacent to our plants 

located at Sangli, Hosur, Santej and Odisha. With our right 

expansion strategies, we are well-poised to cater a larger 

customer base, optimise logistic cost and explore potential 

opportunities in the country.
We prioritised driving technological excellence, enhancing 


centricity. Our innovative product PEX-A-PRO has been 

growing consistently with great response from the 

customers. We further plan to manufacture the high quality 

PEX product in-house by sourcing the best technology and 

machinery from the global experts. Astral has extended 

its product basket by supplying double wall corrugated 

piping solutions in the infrastructure segment through Rex 

Polyextrusion Private Limited (REPL). During the year, we 

took various steps to fortify our brand identity. One  such 

initiative was to bring on board the famous Bollywood 

celebrity, Ranveer Singh, as our new brand ambassador 

which will further add to the brand™s visibility. We also 

launched a unique loyalty program for plumbers across the 

country and a dealer attachment program to strengthen 

the distributor connect.
In our Adhesive & Sealant business, we registered a 
consolidated revenue 
`
 5,830 million and EBIDTA of

capital, which impacted margins to some extent. We

Dear

added products, improve market share and save logistic 

cost in the long-run. 
I would like to conclude with an expression of gratitude

Managing Director
At Astral, our key strategic objective continues to revolve 
around maintaining strong balance sheet quality and 



generation. During the year, we reported a consistent 



margin.  In the coming year, our focus will be on these 



by reducing incremental Capex and increasing capacity 

utilisation of plants.
However, in the last few days of March 2020, we did face 
temporary challenges owing to the enforced lockdown 

and stagnant transportation and manufacturing activities 

across the country. Our inventory piled up which in 

turn positively impacted receivables and debtors days. 

Interestingly, our net working capital days improved from 

38 to 27 on a standalone basis and from 56 to 41 on a 



management that led to such an impressive numbers even 

during challenging times. 
On an operational front, we added infrastructure products 
in our piping portfolio through our acquired business in 

Rex Polyextrusion Private Limited. We undertook various 

structural corrections in our adhesive business which 

impacted topline and margins in the short-term. However, 

we are optimistic that the adhesive division will deliver 



structure, innovative offerings and skilled workforce. The 

Company aims to be debt-free by the end of the year 2021. 
Our positive outcome amidst tough times is a testament 
of our industry leadership, brand equity, backward 

integration, decentralised business model and innovative 





prudence will continue to drive sustainable growth and 

create superior value for our stakeholders going forward.

INDIAN ECONOMY
The Indian economy displayed positive growth trend over 
the past few years on the back of various Government 
initiatives and reforms. The growth outlook was optimistic 
prior to the unexpected Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. 
However, owing to the massive impact of COVID-19, 
almost all the major economies of the world have gone 
through some form of lockdown or social distancing. The 
lockdown in India disrupted the economic activities in 

grew by 4.2% in the FY 2019-20 as compared to 6.8% in 

FY 2018-19.
However, to combat the impact of lockdown, the 
Government implemented various measures. These 
measures included, reduction in repo rate and reverse 
repo rate, moratorium on repayment of term loans among 
others. The Government also provided wage support, in-
kind and cash transfers to lower-income households and 

deferral of tax payments. The Government along with the 
RBI, released a stimulus package of 
`
 20 trillion (mid-May 
2020) which is approximately 10% of GDP. The package 

aims to boost private investments, increase liquidity 
support and infrastructure.
OUTLOOK


expected to mitigate the adverse impact of COVID-19 and 
help reinvigorate the economic activities. The stimulus 
package is expected to foster long-term employment and 
opportunities that will strengthen the economy further. 
On a positive side, the agriculture and allied sector 
functioned smoothly despite the health crisis, displaying 

INDIAN PIPING INDUSTRY OVERVIEW

has clocked a 10% CAGR and now its market size stands at 
~
`
 30,000 crores 
(Source: Article published in the Money 
Control, May 28, 2020)
. Wherein, the 60-65% market 
share accounts to organised players and remaining to 
the unorganised ones (Source: 
Business India, 2019
). 
The major driver behind the growth is Government 
infrastructural spending, increasing constructions, 
industrial production, irrigation sector, replacement of 
aging pipelines, among others. Besides, its superior 
properties and economical cost makes plastic pipes 
favourable over metal pipes. Amongst all plastic pipes, 
the 65% of the industry demand is for Unplasticised 
Polyvinyl Chloride (UPVC), 15% for Chlorinated Polyvinyl 
Chloride (CPVC) and remaining constitute to others 
(Source: 
HDFC securities
, December 2019). There has 
been growing adoption in PVC/CPVC pipes owing to 


handle, environmentally sound and durability features. 
Along with this, increased focused by the Government 
in the end user application will be the major contributor 

in the growth. Consequently, it is also creating upsurge 

attaching of pipe.
OUTLOOK
Going forward, the Indian plastic pipe industry is 
estimated to register a 10% CAGR by 2024-25 to reach 
`
 500 billion (Source: 
Money Control
, May 21, 2020). 
However, in the near term, especially in the Q1 of 2020-

21, the corporate earnings of pipe manufacturers will be 
impacted to some extent owing to slowdown caused by 

the COVID-19. Relative to other sectors, it is still resilient 
as the Government gave boost to agriculture and 
housing sector through handsome stimulus package. 
Also, the relaxation in the lockdown norms will open 
doors for construction and plumbing activities. Besides, 
the industry has 35-40% unorganised players and around 
60-65% organised players. Amid economic slowdown, 
several unorganised and organised players might face 
trouble owing to liquidity issues and weak balance sheet. 


likely to gain sizeable market share.
OPPORTUNITIES AND GROWTH DRIVERS
Consolidation in the industry
Post GST era, the unorganised players in the plastic pipes 

on the price. Now with COVID-19 scenario, the companies 

towards consolidation. This will allow organised players 
with opportunities to acquire regional players at lower 

valuation.
Government initiatives
The Government schemes such as Housing for Allﬂ by 

Bharat Mission, National Rural Drinking Water Programme, 
among others augurs well for the plastic pipe industry. 
These schemes aims at cleanliness, providing basic 
services, such as Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS), and 
ensuring that every household has access to a tap with 

assured water supply and a sewerage connection.
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
ASTRAL POLY TECHNIK LIMITED
39
Replacement of ageing pipes
Traditional pipe material like iron, steel and concrete 
used in the cities and buildings are getting older and 
corroded, reducing its stability. PVC/CPVC pipes are 

highly recommended as replacement by the plumbers 
owing to its lower cost and ease of installations.
Rising aspirations of the middle-class population

income of the middle class population. Presently, there is 
a shift in terms of lifestyle changes, wherein people prefer 
branded and quality tiles/faucet/ceramic to renovate their 
homes and enhance the aesthetic appeal of bathrooms. 
This will in turn create demand for pipes as well.
Hydroponic PVC system
Aspiring urban and conscious farmers are adopting the 
effective way of doing farming in a minimalistic space. 
Once of which is hydroponic method, wherein usage of 
PVC pipe is very popular. With times, increasing number 
of companies will enter into the space to develop 
readymade Hydroponic system.
CHALLENGES
Cost of raw material
The higher raw material prices can increase the production 
cost of the players operating in the industry. However, 
the increase in raw material prices does not impact pipe 
manufacturing players as the higher cost is passed down 
to the downstream industry users.
Stagnation in the construction industry
Slow pace of construction activities can hamper the 
margins of the pipe industry players. However, the 
industry is less likely to be impacted owing to sustained 
demand for replacement of traditional pipes and shift 
from unorganised to organised players.
Slowdown in the capex of the downstream industry
The downstream industry™s cautious approach towards 
capital expenditure in the projects can affect the order 
books of the plastic pipe players. Also, the COVID-19 
situation has made this quite apparent and probably, it 
would take couple more quarters before the things starts 
falling in place.
Indian Adhesive Industry Overview
Adhesives are widely used across numerous end user 
industries such as packaging, construction, furniture, 
automotive, assembly operations among others. The 
major demand for adhesive comes from the packaging 
and automotive industry in the country.
Increase in disposable income levels and booming retail 
markets are propelling growth in packaging industry 
which is conducive for driving demand for adhesives. 
Rapid urbanisation coupled with growing infrastructure 
and real estate construction projects is further projected 
to fuel the demand. An increasing number of global 
as well as domestic adhesive companies have set up 
facilities to address the growing demand for adhesives 

Sealants market is expected to record a CAGR of 11.17% 
during the forecast period of 2019Œ2024.

2019-20 was the tremendous year for Astral as it showed 
an increased product realisation and steady numbers 
even amid turbulent times. The Group™s revenues in 2019-
20 stood at 
`
 25,779 million. The EBIDTA improved by

`
 1,973 million in 
2018-19, an increase of 26.5%.

ANNUAL REPORT 
2019-20
Owing to the unexpected COVID-19 attack and 
subsequent lock down in country, the Company witnessed 
weakened sales in piping and adhesive segments in 
the month of March 2020. Consequently, in the Q4 of 
FY 2019-20, the closing inventory level increased with 
reduced receivables.
However, with strong brand equity, healthy balance sheet 

and multi-location presence, the Company expects to gain 

players in the near future. In addition,
 anticipated 
correction in polymer prices and recent imposition of 

anti-dumping duty in CPVC pipes will also be conducive 
for the Company™s growth.

application of April 1, 2019. The Company elected to use 
the transition practical expedient to not reassess whether 
a contract is, or contains, a lease at April 1, 2019. The 

Company applied the standard only to contracts that were

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an 
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 

regardless of whether that price is directly observable or 
estimated using another valuation technique.
The fair value measurement is based on the presumption 
that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability

Use of
 Estimates

assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and 
disclosure of contingent liabilities. Such estimates 
and assumptions are based on management™s 
evaluation of relevant facts and circumstances as on 

may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed 
on an ongoing basis. Revisions to the accounting 
estimates are recognized in the period in which 
the estimates are revised and in any future periods 
affected.
c)
 
Inventories
Inventories are stated at lower of cost and net

Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised 

when control of the goods or services are transferred 

consideration to which the Company expects to be 
entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
 
Sale of
 goods
Revenue from sale of goods is recognised at the 
point in time when control of the asset is transferred 
to the customer. In determining the transaction price 
for the sale of goods, the Company considers the 
effects of variable consideration, if any.
 
V
ariable consideration
If the consideration in a contract includes a variable 
amount, the Company estimates the amount of 
consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange 
for transferring the goods to the customer. The 
variable consideration is estimated at contract 
inception and constrained until it is highly probable 

of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur 
when the associated uncertainty with the variable

The company assesses at contract inception whether 
a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the 
contract conveys the right to control the use of an 

consideration.

The company applies a single recognition and 
measurement approach for all leases, except for 
short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The

right to use the underlying assets.
 
a.
 
Right-of-use assets
The company recognises right-of-use assets at 


date the underlying asset is available for use). 
Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less 
any accumulated depreciation and impairment 
losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement 
of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use 
assets includes the amount of lease liabilities 
recognised, initial direct costs incurred, 
and lease payments made at or before the

2019-20
commencement date less any lease incentives 
received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on 
a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease 
term and the estimated useful lives of the assets.


At the commencement date of the lease, the 

company recognises lease liabilities measured 
at the present value of lease payments to be 
made over the lease term. The lease payments 


receivable, variable lease payments that depend 
on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to 
be paid under residual value guarantees. The 
lease payments also include the exercise price 

of a purchase option reasonably certain to be 
exercised by the company and payments of 
penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease

depend on an index or a rate are recognised as 

inventories) in the period in which the event or 
condition that triggers the payment occurs.
In calculating the present value of lease 
payments, the company uses its incremental 
borrowing rate at the lease commencement 
date because the interest rate implicit in the 

lease is not readily determinable. After the 
commencement date, the amount of lease

The company applies the short-term lease 

recognition exemption to its short-term leases

incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating 
lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased 
asset and recognised over the lease term on the 

same basis as rental income. Contingent rents are 
recognised as other income in the period in which 
they are earned.

Government grants are recognised where there is 

reasonable assurance that the grant will be received, 
and all attached conditions will be complied with. 
When the grant relates to an expense item, it is 
recognised as income on a systematic basis over the 
periods that the related costs, for which it is intended 
to compensate, are expensed. When the grant 
relates to an asset, it is reduced from the carrying

this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the 
present value of available refunds and reductions in

The undiscounted amount of short-term employee 


services rendered by employees are recognised 
during the year when the employees render the 

absences which are expected to occur within twelve 
months after the end of the period in which the 
employee renders the related service.

Compensated absences which are not expected 

to occur within twelve months after the end of the 
period in which the employee renders the related 
service are recognised as a liability at the present 

to be made by the Company in respect of services 
provided by employees up to the balance sheet 
date.
 
Shar
e based payment:
Equity settled share based payments to employees 

are measured at the fair value of the equity 
instruments at the grant date. The fair value 
determined at the grant date of the equity settled 
share based payments is expensed on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period, based on the 
Company™s estimate of equity instruments that will 
eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in 
equity.

At the end of each reporting period, the Company 
reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and

any indication that those assets have suffered an 
impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the 
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in

Company estimates the recoverable amount of the

Business combina
tions
At the time of acquisition, the Company considers 

whether each acquisition represents the acquisition 
of a business or the acquisition of an asset. The 
Company accounts for an acquisition as a business 
combination where an integrated set of activities 
and assets, including property, is acquired. More 


particular, the extent of services provided by the 


Business combinations are accounted for using 
the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition 
is measured as the aggregate of the consideration 
transferred measured at acquisition date fair value 
and the amount of any non-controlling interests in 
the acquiree.

acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised 
at their acquisition date fair values. For this purpose, 
the liabilities assumed include contingent liabilities 
representing present obligation and they are 

measured at their acquisition fair values irrespective 


When the Company acquires a business, it assesses 


accordance with the contractual terms, economic 

circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the 
acquisition date.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the 
excess of the aggregate of the consideration 
transferred and the amount recognised for non-
controlling interests, and any previous interest 

liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets 
acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration 
transferred, the Company re-assesses whether it has 


of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures 
used to measure the amounts to be recognised at 
the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results 
in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired 
over the aggregate consideration transferred, then 
the gain is recognised in OCI and accumulated in 

evidence of bargain purchase, the entity recognises 

the gain directly in equity as capital reserve, without 
routing the same through OCI.

Oper
ating Cycle
The Company presents assets and liabilities in 
the balance sheet based on current / non-current 

An asset is treated as current when it is:

or consumed in normal operating cycle;

3.
 
Expected 
to be realised within twelve months 
after the reporting period, or

being exchanged or used to settle a liability for 
at least twelve months after the reporting period

A liability is current when:
1.
 
It is e
xpected to be settled in normal operating 
cycle;
2.
 
It is held primarily for the purpose of

of estimation uncertainty

conformity with the Ind AS requires management 


that affect the application of accounting policies 
and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and 

the reported amounts of the revenues and expenses 
for the years presented. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experience and 
other factors that are considered to be relevant. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates under 
different assumptions and conditions. The estimates 

and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates 
are recognised in the period in which the estimate 
is revised if the revision affects only that period, or 
in the period of the revision and future periods if the 
revision affects both current and future periods.
