0,,". Management Discussion and Analysis 1. OVERVIEW There were far reaching structural reforms implemented in the Indian economy in the last seventeen months starting from November 2016. In the process these measures have put the economy on sound growth path. They augur well to put the economy in high growth mode in future. The most significant reform was introduction of Goods and Service Tax w.e.f 1.7.2017. This single measure has integrated the Country’s economy. Overall, the incidence of indirect tax has come down on most of the products by this measure of merging several indirect taxes and cess charged on the products in different States prior to July 2017. The streamlining of GST implementation and Tax rates took some time. That has created upheaval in 1st half of last year. For your Company’s business, the introduction of Realty Estate regulation Act (RERA) has also affected growth of piping business in Housing Sector for several months. The several initiatives taken by Government to boost rural income and infrastructure are now fructifying to boost business in several segments which are catered by the Company . The Company, therefore, envisaged a faster growth in business from April 2018 and beyond. On the basis of the promising future demand growth, the Company started committing larger investments during the year than planned at beginning of the year. Due to hardening of Polymer Prices and lack of new capacity build up of the PVC resin all around the world, the PVC prices have moved to higher band. For the year 2018-19, it is expected that the PVC price trend will remain on higher side. In spite of increase in Crude prices, the prices of Polythene will move to a lower level over the year as several new plants are starting in USA based on the low feed stock cost of Shale gas. Overall, the polymer prices will remain affordable. The effect of Demonetization , GST and RERA looks to have settled down to a large extent. The economy is moving to formal sector slowly, but surely from informal sector. This augurs well to boost the economic activity in the Country. The initial forecast for Monsoon this year is also normal. Company, therefore, expects business conditions to be favorable in the year to boost the demand for it’s products. The Company expects to put two new Greenfield plants in production this year – one at Telangana and another at Rajasthan. The Company’s additional construction of buildings in existing plants and start up of production at those sites will also go in production this year at Malanpur, Khopoli, Hosur and Kharagpur. The Company intends to start two new plants at Andhra Pradesh and Assam. Land acquisition process has started. They may partially go into production next year. The Company’s units to make up automobile products at Khuskhera has been put in JV with a Japanese Company. The Company may divest it’s small holding in that Unit within 2-3 years after start up of this J.V 2.

To attain this objective, the Company has added further distributors in the past year. The distributors strength has gone up to 3303.Nos by the end of March 2018 compared to 2973 nos by March 2017. Wherever the Company could not find suitable distributors to buy and stock Company’s products for re-distribution throughout the retail chain of that area, the Company started selling products directly to big retailers in that area. Selectively, the Company has strengthened it’s supply system to service those retailers in a cost efficient manner. The Company started this only very selectively.

The Company participated in several exhibitions in India and internationally last year. Secondly Company is taking legal recourse to contain counterfeit products in Plastics pipe System, XF Products and Furniture. Company assiduously works to address this menace. 4. OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE 4.1 Plastics Piping Systems The Company continues its objective to grow in Plastic Pipe System business. The company is leader in this segment as it has the largest portfolio of products, which is being continuously increased, to offer more systems as required in the economy. The introduction of GST regime in the country augured well for growth of this business. There is likelihood of shift in business from unorganized players to organized players over the period. This is expected to lead to growth in the business of your Company in forthcoming years. The Company during the year under review registered an over all revenue growth of 10% in Plastic Piping System made from different plastic materials. Overall the company sold 2,56,330 Tons of Pipe System compared to 2,35,256 Tons in same period of last year. The growth in the business was not upto Company’s expectation. GST introduction has put damper in Agri market requirement in April/June. Real Estate Regulation Act (RERA) to regulate the Housing Sector has slowed down the demand from this sector for quite a period. The Government at the Centre and States has put the priority focus on Swatch Bharat Abhiyan, Sanitation and affordable houses to all and development of 100 smart cities on all India basis. Real Estate Regulation Act (RERA) has created a major transformation the way housing construction for sale was in vogue in the Country. It affected the business growth in Housing in the year under review. The growth tempo has now started and the Company expects good demand coming from this segment in this year. The Company incurred Capex of R 144 crore in this year in it’s various plants to build more capacities and increase product range. Majority of them has been put to use . The Company with objective of making its footprint for manufacturing at South Zone, for Plastic Piping Division, has got 50 acres of land allotted at Jadcherla-District Mahaboobnagar at Telangana. The civil construction work has started and production of Water & Septic Tanks is likely to start in October/December ’2018. The Company will launch other Piping System products at this location in next one/ two year. The Company has entered into a MOU with the State Government of Andhra Government to put up a project at Nellore district. Efforts are being made to acquire the required land of approx. 40 acres to start the manufacturing there. The Company aims to start production at the same site in second half of 2019-2020. The plant at Kharagpur is fully operational. The capacity increase for PVC,HDPE & CPVC Pipes is now in place and become operational. The Company is also exploring further increasing the capacity of HDPE Pipe at Kharagpur plant to cater to increased demand. To meet the increasing demand of HDPE Pipes in North India, the Company has taken in hand to put up the capacity in Malanpur Unit No.3. The same will go in production in July/ September 2018 quarter. Another Roto Moulding plant is now operational at Kharagpur. The enhanced capacity at Gadegaon facility for Roto Moulded Products is made operational. The capacity of Roto Moulded Products is being planned to increase at Malanpur and Kanpur plant. The production of Double Wall Corrugated HDPE Pipes has started from Gadegaon plant with BIS Certification. The company has also started commercial production of Double Wall Corrugated HDPE Pipes at Kharagpur. At Kharagpur the BIS certification for Pipes up to diameter of 500 mm is received and for balance sizes of 600 mm and 800 mm diameter is likely to be received shortly. 42 n THE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED The company introduced 195 nos. of variety of Injection Moulded Pipe fittings during 2017-18. They all have been well received in the market. The sale of moulded fittings increased by 6% in volume terms during the year under review. The Company has plan of introducing further new items during the year as per system requirement. The Company manufactures the cPVC Pipes at three of its manufacturing location and cPVC Fittings at two of its manufacturing locations. The Company has planned further expansion of CPVC System manufacturing at it’s existing plants. The total product portfolio in Pipe System has reached 7730 nos., thus adding 500 products to the range of various Plastic Piping System. The AQUAKRAFT Bath Fittings introduced by the company is well established now including newly launched Chrome Plated range. There were 11 new items introduced during the year. The portfolio in Bath Fittings has reached to 100 items. For test market, Company also imported 16 variety of Bath Fittings to service local market. The Company plans to further complement the range during 2018-19 by introducing large varieties of products in Bath fittings. The Company’s business to Export market during the year saw a growth of 48% in US $ terms. The company is continuously trying to boost its export business of Piping Systems. The Division’s Value Added Products sale was 31.76%. The company has also added further 68 direct business Channel partners during the year taking the total to 984 Nos.. The Company continues to expand its reach by appointing Distributors in areas where there is a gap. The company has also started directly servicing retailers in selected markets. The Company has now multiple Knowledge Centres across the country to facilitate the services locally. At Gadegaon for the customers of Western India, at Kochi for the customers of Southern India, at Malanpur for customers of Northern India and at Kharagpur for customers of Eastern India. Although Company’s CPVC Fire Sprinkler System is approved by Bureau of Indian Standard (BIS) and is also Underwriters Laboratories (UL) listed, still the Company needs product approval to install in Residential /Commercial Buildings. There is no single authority to approve the product and every State Government has their own rules and regulations to be followed in their States. Certain states got Central Authority called “Director Fire Services” and the approval is acceptable to all the Fire Officers and Fire stations within their States. But in certain States the Company has to seek approval from every Chief Fire Officer of a city which has status of Municipal Corporation. Seeking approval is a time consuming process. Thus the growth in this segment will be slow though it is internationally proven a better system than metal Fire Sprinkler System for Horizontal Application. The BIS has not yet published the standard for CPVC Fire Sprinkler Fittings and also many amendments to IS- 15105, which is a standard for design and installation of Fire Sprinkler System. Although National Building Code 2016 has been published the implementation part has still not gathered pace. As a result the awareness about mandatory installation of CPVC Fire Sprinkler System in High-rise Residential Apartments as well as Commercial buildings is not catching the momentum. The Company is putting lot of efforts in creating awareness about it’s products by meeting various Developers, Consultants and Installers in all the major Metropolitan and Tier-I cities. As a result of these efforts the Company could install this system at Mumbai, Pune and Goa locations for many upcoming Highrise Buildings. These installations will work as a showcase to present it to future buyers, consultants and installers. The installers who did the mock-up installations are truly satisfied. They see tremendous benefit because of ease and speed of installation while using this product. They have confirmed that the speed of installation is four times faster than the earlier metal installations and the skill requirement is less as no welding or threading operations are involved. The Company has developed moulds for fast running fittings and the samples are already under testing with Underwriters Laboratories (UL). This will enhance Company’s efficiency in delivering the products to the end users with speed. The Company has started participating in various “Fire and Safety” Exhibitions in India as well as abroad as part of promotional activities. This is helping in creating awareness to ‘Supreme Flameguard’ Brand . The Company is getting good response from Indian as well as Overseas buyers. Apart from installation in India the Company has supplied it’s products to a hotel project in Sri Lanka and to a renowned distributor in Philippines. The Company expects that most of the regulatory approvals will be over and indigenous development of products should be complete during the current Calendar year. The business may catch momentum from the second half of the current financial year. To support environment concern the Company is gearing up to meet with National Green Tribunal and court directive of phasing out Lead stabilizers from manufacturing of different types of u PVC Pipes. The Company is planning a phased out schedule for different variety of PVC Pipes having Lead stabilizers to produce with Lead free stabilizers. 4.2 Consumer Products 4.2.1 FURNITURE The business during the year had a good growth. The company grew by 11 % on value terms and 8 % on volume terms where as the overall Plastic Furniture Industry grew by only 4 % on value terms. The company faced initial hiccups in business with GST regime. Sales in First Quarter were extremely sluggish due to introduction of GST and reduction in pipeline inventory with trade channels. Further, the GST rate which was kept at 28 % in the beginning had an adverse effect on the business. However, reduction in GST rate from 28 % to 18 % gave boost to the business and the growth in second half of 2017-18 was a healthy 16% on value terms. The company believes that with reduction in GST rate & effective compliance, the share of organized players should increase in overall plastic furniture business over the period. The company currently manufactures Injection Moulded Furniture & Blow Moulded Furniture. It has 5 units manufacturing Injection Moulded Furniture across the country at Puducherry (UT), Durgapur (West Bengal), Derabassi THE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED n 43 (Punjab), Gadegaon (Maharashtra) & Guwahati (Assam) to cater effectively different regions of the country. The company has also started manufacturing Blow Moulded Tables at its Kharagpur (West Bengal) plant. The company is putting up a Green Field Plant at Jadcherla ( Telangana ) for manufacture of Injection Moulded Furniture for increasing its market share in Southern India. The company believes the new plant will also be a good feeder unit for all other parts of the country due to its central location and good connectivity. The plant is likely to go in production by third quarter of this year and contribute to growth in last two quarters. The growth in company’s business is primarily attributed to its continuing focus on increasing its distribution set up and delivering high quality product & service to its customers. The company’s furniture is currently available to its customers through nationwide network of around 11,000 retailers .The company has established itself as a premium brand amongst its trade channel and customers due to its continuous focus on Quality, innovation and wide range of products. During the year, the company increased its strength of channel partners from 814 Nos. to 900 Nos. and continues to increase its presence in the unrepresented areas. The company’s new product line of Blow Moulded Tables has been well received by customers and is considered as top class in Quality. At present, the company is offering Tables in 8 Sizes and will be adding 4 more sizes by end of September 2018. The company also plans to develop more products to cater different market segments. The product line requires intensive marketing combined with education about its benefits vis a vis other conventional wooden tables and the company hopes to grow in 2018-19 in this segment primarily from domestic market. The export potential for this product line is big. The Company’s quality of product is far superior comparable to competitive products in the world market. Once the range becomes large and get well established in domestic market , then the Company aims to launch it’s product in international markets. The company introduced 7 new furniture models during the year. The Fusion Series of Cupboards found very high acceptance amongst the customers due to its unique aesthetic deign. The company also launched its two seater rattan finish Love Seat Sofa which made an ideal combination with its fast selling model Cambridge Chair and Vegas Center Table . The complete set has been well appreciated in domestic as well as International Market. All the new models introduced during the year were well appreciated and the company hopes to get good growth from its new introductions. The company continues to focus on developing its export market and has found good acceptance by various customers. The company has now started exports to Twelve countries and hopes to grow substantially from this segment. The Company participates in several exhibitions to promote it’s quality products. 4.3 Industrial Products 4.3.1 Industrial Components The year started against the backdrop of improved business sentiments resulting from gradual economic recovery because of various reforms initiated by the government. Demand revival took momentum in various segments including Automotive and Consumer Durable sector in which the Division has major business portfolio. At the beginning of the year, the Division had projected growth of 20% and 12% in Value and Volume terms in both the sectors put together. The initial negative effect of major economic Structural Reforms like Demonetization and GST having faded, demand progressively picked up in all segments of Automobile sector like 2 Wheeler/3 Wheeler, Cars/SUVs and Commercial Vehicles and in White Goods like washing Machines, Refrigerators and other home appliances. The good monsoon also helped demand boost in Automotive and Appliances. Division grew by 31% and 18% respectively in Volume and Value terms over previous year. With microeconomic parameters encouraging, GST getting stabilized and improved confidence in economy, the Company expects further expansion in demand which should pave the way for further growth during the current year. Noida Plant revenue had improved significantly during the year under review and grew by 46% . Noida plant improved its customer base to have sizable spread in non-Appliances to counter seasonal demand volatility. Hence plant could achieve fairly uniform production with low level of volatility. Demand for AC segment improved considerably showing healthy growth. Company expects AC segment to grow significantly and concentrating on new customer development in this product line. In order to meet improved demand of one of Company’s major AC customer and reduce logistics cost for the customer, company decided to put up a new plant at Ghiloth, Rajasthan and started the project work in full swing. The project is already at last leg of completion and expected to go in production in April-June, quarter. With the continued efforts in developing new Business Mix, company expects steady growth at Noida plant in future.

During the year, the Plant cleared Initial Assessment and Final Audit for TPM Excellence by JIPM (Japan Institute of Plant Maintenance). The Plant received the prestigious Award of TPM Excellence during the year. The movement will be accelerated further to next level during the years to come. Auto Business in the western India which started showing recovery during FY 16-17 accelerated further during FY17-18 improving revenue of Talegaon Plant resulting in robust growth of 58% in sales revenue. The business of some automotive models, which were acquired during previous years from the major customer Tata Motors, started showing demand pick up. Supply of Cockpit Assembly which started for the LCV/ MCV Model ‘Ultra’ of Tata Motors; during previous year, ramped up considerably and is expected to improve further during coming years. The New 2 Wheeler model SR 150 and the existing Vespa together registered better demand improving revenue of Talegaon plant. Plant Capacity Utilization improved significantly. Company is aggressively focusing to improve business at Talegaon by strengthening its Business Development cell. Khushkhera Plant sales revived and grew by 8%. Supplies have been successfully established for one of the prestigious 44 n THE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED SUV model of Honda Car, WR-V. Development is on for several other models for Maruti Suzuki and Honda. Company has been continuously exploring good business opportunities from Maruti, Honda and other tier one customers in many of their new models. However, it is felt that Company needs to strengthen its capabilities and reorganize not only a component supplier but also to become complete source of supply right from designing, development to supply of products which can be done effectively by the Company having such technical strength and capabilities. Keeping the same in mind,Company has entered into a joint venture with Kumi Kasei Co., Ltd (Kumi), a company incorporated in Japan, to set up a new entity by the name of Kumi Supreme India Private Limited (JVC). Kumi is a major supplier to Honda for many interior parts for automotive application all over the world. They have been Company’s Technology Partner for the last six years for Company’s automotive supplies to Honda in India. The JVC would take over Khushkhera plant operations as a going concern on a slump sale basis. Transaction is likely to be completed by 30th June, 2018. This Joint Venture may further improve technological competence of the Auto Comp Business and will help in strengthening Company’s relationship with all it’s customers. Business opportunities are encouraging for Chennai Plant. Plant registered growth of only 4% as company couldn’t grab the business opportunities due to capacity constraints in the plant. Currently plant is running at its optimum capacity. Company is now in the process of acquiring land adjacent to its existing facility, which will be used for expanding the plant. Company plans to expand and increase the plant capacity to facilitate acquiring future opportunities. Bosch has set up its huge manufacturing facility in India, at Chennai and would be launching various other Home Appliance products during next few years. Company expects good growth with this customer in years to come. The prospects in automotive sector for this unit are looking bright and it is expected to form a significant portion of plant revenue. Company has planned to realign its Customer-Mix for more productive capacity utilization.

The Crate Division has shown a volume growth of 18%. The Company’s Crates are used in various segments which includes Automobile, FMCG, White Goods, Engineering, Retail sectors. Company also provides customized solution by fabrication to it’s valued customers. This business has shown healthy growth of 30%.

Therefore there was no growth possible in the year under review. Overall sale was 7454 tons in the year under review vis a vis 7596 tons in the previous year. The sales in value term dropped from R 129.40 Crores to R 125.31 Crores . This was due to fall in raw material prices as well as drop in selling price. During the year under review, exports stood at 1659 tons as against 1028 tons in corresponding period of previous year. The company’s thrust on export resulted in robust growth of 61 % in volume. This trend will continue with addition of new customers in several geographies. The customers of the Company have shown confidence in the quality of Company’s films and service. The division’s sales have been consistent and customer base could be maintained by virtue of quality of products & high service standards. As the capacity of the division remains fully utilised, the division has committed an investment of R 41 crores to expand its capacity at existing Khopoli unit..

This will increase the capacity by around 5000 Tons per annum. 4.4.2 Protective packaging division (PPD) Protective packaging division (PPD) recorded 16% growth in value & 17.5% in volume during the year under review. The total sale was 23335 tons against 19853 tons last year Overall packaging business was good during the year under review. The de-growth of the business of insulation grade cross-linked polyethylene foam has continued, as more competitors entered the business during the year. Most of the manufacturers are supplying substandard products against their own declared specifications. The division has taken up a challenge to build quality awareness among the customers and approving authorities by several modes of communication. This is however a long drawn process. NBR sheet plant has commenced production in the first week of April after a delay of over 4 months due to delayed supply of equipments. This will enhance Company’s product offering for insulation range of products. However competition may remain fierce in the coming year. Many of the civil projects are getting restarted and it is expected that the demand will improve for the DURA range of products in the current year. The market response for the new ranges of products like children education toys, sports, health sector, & interiors which were launched last year has been encouraging. A wide range of interlock mats are now well established in the market. The division is also developing sport specific certified interlock mats. The division is now an approved vendor of Decathlon, a leading global sports goods retailer, for yoga mats. Several other products are in the pipeline for approval. The acoustic range of products haven’t picked up as well as expected, due to the limited availability of NBR bonded block foam and some technical issues related to the other range of products. The division is expecting a good growth of business of this vertical during the year due to enhanced availability of the NBR bonded block foam. Hosur unit I & 2 will be merged alongwith the expansion at unit 2 & is expected to go in full production by August 2018. Unit 1 operation will then be shut down. The company would divest the land & building of this unit thereafter. The production capacity of Kharagpur unit will be enhanced by 2600 MTPA during the current year by constructing a new building and addition of Cross Linked Foam products. The division is also doing the feasibility study for enhancing production capacity at Malanpur. The division has started work at the Jadcherla complex which is being set up. Production should start in the last quarter of the financial year 2018-19. The division has also decided to establish more fabrication facilities including expansion of existing ones at different locations to capture high value added fabrication business. The division has also started getting good demand of civil and insulation range of products from the middle-east market. There would be a significant growth of exports in the coming year. Present production capacity of 28,600 tons will increase to 38,500 TPA without considering Jadcherla and Malanpur expansion. Packaging Packaging vertical grew by 20.08% in value and 21% in volume as against last year. Enhanced productivity & improved quality standards have been achieved by re-engineering of existing equipment/equipments resulting in growth of business. The R & D team is also working on developments of new variants of polyethylene foam range of products which are application specific. 46 n THE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED The new bubble plant which was installed last year at Hosur unit has been modified for the production of new range of composite products which was not possible earlier in any of our existing equipments. The Company expects good growth in the premium range of products during the year. Business of two stage block foam which was sluggish over the past few years is now picking up and it is expected that the capacity will be well utilized in the current year. Business of EVA foam moulded products has not yet started. Several products for the sports & health sector have been identified & will be launched by the end of 1st quarter. Further products would be added in the year. Civil Business grew by 9.18% value and 1.55% by volume in the current year. The division has been awarded BIS certification for its DURA HD 100 for expansion joint application. Demand for DURA range of products is now increasing for the business in project based business. To cater the demand, the division is planning to expand cross-linked block foamed production capacity at various locations. The division is also working on development of new range of civil products which are application oriented and a cost effective solution to the customers. Insulation The growth of Insulation division was 7.29% in value & 3.51% in volume. As informed earlier, several new competitors entered the business simultaneously & dropped prices inappropriately while compromising on desired quality standards. This had severely impacted Company’s business & profitability. However, constant efforts to sell products based on required quality standards has started to yield results. NBR sheet plant will expand existing portfolio of products in this vertical. Technology The Technical team of the division has been working on innovative ideas to develop new products, new applications, & upgrading of existing processing facilities and other segments. The Company’s innovative & light weight products have been beneficial to industry & the society at large The Indian Green Building Council ( IGBC ) has certified all of Company’s insulation range of products. The division has also received 8th Plasticon Award in the category of “Innovation in Polymer Waste Management and Recycling Technology” on the bonded block foam. 4.4.3 Cross Laminated Film The Business of Cross Laminated film and products had a de-growth during the year which witnessed slow down in economy in the first half due to roll out of Goods & Service Tax (GST). Several new players have also entered this business in the country claiming to make similar products like our Company. Combination of these two factors have affected the volume & margins in this segment of business. Prior to launch of GST on 1st July, 2017 there was lot of confusion, particularly amongst the traders, regarding eligibility of credit of duties paid on purchase of goods which remained in stock on the date of GST implementation. Most of the company’s dealers curtailed purchases to maintain stocks at a very low level. This adversely impacted sale of company’s products during the first quarter of the year which are supposed to be the peak months for the sale of tarpaulins. In the GST regime, the company’s main product tarpaulin was placed initially in the highest rate bracket i.e. 28%. This made the product costly to the end users. After lot of representations at various forums the GST rate on tarpaulin was reduced from 28% to 18% but in the meantime company lost sizeable business. Though the sales picked up from September onwards, the loss of sales during the first five months could not be recouped. There was small growth in the 35GSM Silpoly Liner business. The company is promoting this product in newer applications with positive response. As per the prediction of India Meteorological Department the 2018 monsoon is expected to be normal brightening the chances of recovery in the farm sector & growth in rural economy. This may boost the demand for Company’s products, most of which find application in agriculture sector. The company is hopeful of getting increased foothold in the USA market in the coming years. The company is working on developing specialized new applications to increase the size of market. The company aims to bringing in new customers in its fold in the existing markets & reaching out new markets where at present it does not have any presence by show casing its products in various international exhibitions. With enhanced capacity at its disposal the company has made Cross Line (XL) Bonded Film available in almost all thicknesses. This product has superior properties than the normal XF Film & enjoys patent protection. The company has now acquired all the rights in the patents of Cross Line Bonded Film from the technical collaborator. This will bring in lot of savings in the royalties in the coming years as the sale of this product is expected to grow. In the coming year the thrust will be on developing newer applications and entering into several international markets. The company has developed many new fabricated products apart from Tarpaulin. Due to its superior properties it is getting increased acceptance in different applications. The company has successfully introduced this product in different applications by laminating the film with other substrate. The technical collaborator of the company is working in tandem with the prospective customers of Cross Plastic Film to perfect the product in all respects. Once the product is perfected the company will be putting up plant to manufacture this product at its Muvala plant. 4.5 Construction Business The company has developed Commercial Premises viz “Supreme Chambers” with a view to monetize the land parcel where its first own manufacturing unit was functional.

There were some minor technical issues on the cylinders supplied by the Company to Korea and Bangladesh. All those issues have been resolved and clients have started discussions for repeat orders. It is encouraging to note that Bangladesh has been using cylinders for last one year and the Company is negotiating to supply larger quantities in the current year. Market demands 15.6 and 20 kg. cylinders. Company developed the cylinders and got approval from TUV, PESO and KGS. In this, a trial lot has been shipped to Korea in 20 kg. cylinder and the Company expects to have a good volume in these sizes since the country being a coastal region faces a problem of rusting of steel cylinders. The much awaited BIS Standards is complete and BIS 16646 has been published for Type IV composite cylinders. This was necessary so that oil market companies can now take effective steps to introduce composite cylinders in Indian market. The feedback has been good from Company’s customers for it’s cylinders on whatever small quantities supplied by the Company to Private Gas Companies in Goa, Belgaum and Bengaluru. Company hopes to see better off-take from Indian Gas Companies in coming year.

The Repo rate, was at 6.00% at the start of the year touched a high of 6.50% in the December, 2018 Thereafter the RBI has reduced the Repo Rate by 25 bps each in February 2019 & in April 2019 aggregating to the reduction of 50 bps in their respective monetary review meetings. Thus the Repo Rate has been gradually brought down to 6.00%presently. The higher rates generally resulted in relatively higher cost of borrowing for the working capital requirements of the Company. 2. Working Capital Borrowing 2.1. Foreign Currency Borrowing After the discontinuation of Letter of Undertakings (LOUs) by RBI, availability of low cost Working capital Credit in foreign currency (Buyer’s credits) became scarce initially. However, the Company has managed to restart availing of Buyer’s credit funding, directly from overseas lenders at competitive rates. 2.2. Commercial Papers During the year under review, the Company continued to place cost effective Commercial Papers (CPs) in the market to avail low cost INR funding. However, with the latest guidelines from RBI, w.e.f. 1st April, 2019, borrowers will have to avail 40% (60% w.e.f. 1st July, 2019) of Fund based limits by way of Working capital demand loans (WCDL) from Banks. As a result the Company’s cost of borrowing is expected to go up, as it will have to reduce its exposure to CPs and Buyer’s Credits, in favour of costlier WCDLs.) 2.3. Dealers’ financing & Vendor Management. The Dealers’ finance facilities extended to the selected Channel Partners of the Company has progressed well with more & more Channel Partners are interested to get enrolled on the Channel Finance Scheme.

CRISIL Rating During the year, the Rating for Company’s Short term bank facilities was reaffirmed at “CRISIL A1+” by CRISIL (which is highest rating for the Short term instruments). CRISIL vide its letter dated 2nd April 2019 has upgraded the Rating for Long Term Bank facilities from “CRISIL AA Stable” to “CRISIL AA Positive (Outlook Revised from stable and rating reaffirmed)”. The outlook revision is driven by improvement in the company’s business risk profile led by strengthening presence in the domestic market backed by wider distribution network and expected increase in number of manufacturing facilities.

The Company’s business had grown by 4% in Value terms and 3% in Volume terms for 11 months and was expected to grow in same ratio had the lockdown not been announced. The overall sales of organized players in Plastic Furniture segment has been stagnant or infact declined for 11 month period. However, the sales of unorganized players continued to grow at local level. The Company expects that with it’s range of different types of Furniture and brand strength coupled with countrywide reach, it will overcome the competition from unorganized players. The Company started manufacture of Roto Moulded Furniture with a limited range at its Kharagpur Roto Moulding Unit during the year. The company now manufactures furniture made with all three different technologies i.e Injection Moulding, Blow Moulding and Roto Moulding.

The Company has already completed the initial vendor assessment process and its Lalru Unit has cleared the SMETA audit required for Social Compliance by most of the Global large retailers. 4.3 INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS 4.3.1 INDUSTRIAL COMPONENTS After the encouraging first half of FY18-19, from Nov. 18 onwards, unexpected slump in the demand for both Auto and Consumer Durables was witnessed and it lasted through Q4 of FY18-19. However, country wide sentiment was indicating that there would be pick up post General Elections due in April-May’19. Based on this expectation, the Division planned 6% to 8% growth during FY19-20 over FY18-19, both in Auto and Appliances sector. However, slow down continued without expected recovery in both the segments even after General Elections. Slowdown in Auto sector intensified due to various Statutory changes in Vehicle Safety Norms, impending BSVI implementation resulting in cautious buying, difficulties in availing Vehicle loans resulting from NBFC crises, Weak Economic sentiments due to various Global and Domestic factors. In case of CVs where the company has larger presence as TIER 1 supplier, in addition to the above stated factors, demand took beating due to Statutory Axle load increase and drastically improved Vehicle Turnaround Time ( TAT), a healthy effect of GST, allowing seamless Vehicle Movement across the country. On a larger base of FY 18-19 Sales attained because of nonrecurring sizable order from ECIL for EVM sub-assemblies and First Quarter revenue from the hived off Khushkhera plant coupled with the combination of factors as stated above, the Division had to encounter de-growth of 27% and excluding these two effects, the de-growth has been about 16%. Ghiloth plant set up exclusively for one of the major Appliances manufacturer completed its first full year of operations. This business was shifted from Noida plant. Noida and Ghiloth plants put together achieved revenue growth of about 10%. Noida plant stabilized Cooler production for one of its customers with improved Productivity, Quality and Operational efficiency. One of the Company’s major customer in Appliances sector from Noida plant was discontinued by the company as it was showing signs of bankruptcy and that’s what happened eventually. Although, this was a necessary step, obviously, it affected revenue of the plant for the year under review. The WCE Program which was launched for both Noida and Ghiloth plants, has started showing improvements and will be more visible in the years to come. Division had one rented premises in Greater Noida which had been part of Noida Plant administratively. Company undertook a major Re-Engineering Exercise codenamed Noida Integration Project. Noida plant was completely relayed out with the aim to bring operations of both these plants at single location. This resulted in better space utilization, effective management THE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED 34 controls, improved layout, clean environment and effective cost management. The Company expects good results of this action in the future. Since Commercial vehicle segment was severely hit and Talegaon plant having more dependence on Commercial vehicles, it suffered on revenues considerably. Company’s major customer for Pondy plant which manufactures Washing machines, encountered de-growth in the segment where Company’s presence is sizable. This impacted company’s revenue resulting in de-growth of the Division in Puducherry plant. Company has undertaken exercise of Business Rationalization with this customer which should mitigate risk of overdependence on one segment and improve revenues in future. Company received “Excellent Business Partner Award” from this customer, a unique recognition given for long and sustained mutual business association. Chennai plant has customer base both for Appliance and Automotive. One of the major customers stopped manufacturing TVs in India and contracted out AC manufacturing to third party. These actions from the said customer had adverse impact on the revenue of Chennai plant. However, company has acquired new businesses from existing customers and added couple of new customers. It should bring positive results during current and future years. The expansion of the plant undertaken last year has been completed in March, 20 and became operational. Durgapur plant is mainly depending on Auto sector. Due to sluggish demand from Auto sector throughout the year, Division’s business had to suffer de-growth in the revenue. There was a considerable effect on supply chain of some of our major customers due to non-availability of few critical materials from China which was shut down to contain the spread of Covid 19 during February’20 and March’20. Overall revenue of the division adversely affected during last quarter due to wide spread slump in the economy, supply failures from China and nearly half of March month shut due to Covid 19 lock down. Appropriate steps have been taken in all plants to follow right protocols and Operational SOPs including Norms for Social Distancing, Personal Hygiene, Sanitization, Environmental aspects etc. to contain spread of Covid19. Health, Safety and Hygiene has been taken on top of agenda. Company has taken drive to rationalize and reorient the machine capacities at its various locations to align it with the changed Product- Mix. While doing so, the new machines and equipment being added are equipped with the latest Technology, Energy efficient, designed for Good repeatability for better quality and improved productivity. Wherever feasible and cost-effective, Automation is being considered to for better productivity and quality. All these initiatives will ensure enhanced Quality, Productivity, Safety, Energy conservation and Cost Optimization. It is helping the Company to negate the impact of inflation due to various manufacturing cost increases and cost reductions required to be given year on year to customers to remain competitive. The various such initiatives of the Company would support Environment and help Go Green. Continuous focus on employee engagement initiatives is helping company to enhance its Human Capital. Overall rating of the company by its customers meets or exceeds their expectations. Company is considered a highly dependable and valuable supplier. The Journey towards excellence is being cultivated as a culture and will be continuous. 4.3.2 Material Handling Products The footprints of Indian economy right at the beginning of the financial year were not encouraging. Most of the sectors of economy started the new year with subdued activities. The affect was most pronounced in Automobile, Engineering, and Consumer durables, Automobiles was also severely affected due to some statutory guidelines from Govt. and NBFC financial crisis. If the Company divides the year in two halves, the first half has been good for material handling products division. Company’s MH Division has been growing in both volumes and revenue fighting against odds more so when most of the driving sectors for material handling division were not performing well. The second half of the year has been disappointing for MHD. The effect appeared starting from 3rd quarter for most of the product range, The fourth quarter was even worse with the onset of COVID-19 and lockdown in March. Consequently, MHD ended year with a negative of 4% in volume and a negative of 7% in revenue. Industrial crates which are primarily demanded from sectors like auto, engineering, appliances, FMCG and retail have 2% negative in volume and 8% negative in revenue. The same has been with pallets which are used for warehousing, storage in industrial, retail and FMCG have shown a degrowth of around 4% in volume and 8% in revenue. Among the gloom, some positive strings have also flared for the company as few segments outshined and shown positive results. The Fruit and Vegetable (F&V) and Fisheries crates segment, even when The Company serves only the quality conscious customers and refrain from selling to mass markets and mandis abuzzed with recycled crates, have performed well F&V crates have particularly been impressive with an increase of 1.5 lakhs more units and registered a growth of around 15% over last year. This performance was also supported by introduction of new models. Dairy Crates have also performed reasonably well during the year and new model in Dairy crates have shown promise for a bigger market volume this year. The Roto segment has been poor both in crates, dustbins and pallets but the injection moulded dustbins models have shown positive trends and promise for good results in this year. The bottle crates sold to other than major players have also been on the positive side over the last year. There has been a massive disruption in majority of sectors i.e. Engineering, Appliances, Automobiles which were catered by the Company have lost ground in volumes. More importantly, the polymer prices have fallen with almost 15% in prices on average over the last year. Your company is still confident of good surge in business this year in fisheries, F&V, retail and FMCG segments even when we feel that the first quarter in all possibilities would be consumed by the lockdown with less activity. The division has planned to open two new fabrication facilities for speedy and timely service to the customers requiring customised crates in both South and North regions. New injection moulded dustbins models and few new crates models have also been planned for introduction. The Management is focussed to increase the customer coverage specially in East and North east, Maharasthra and Southern India, by filling up the vacancies and further strengthening ANNUAL REPORT 2019-20 THE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED 35 network of channel partners by adding new partners in some less or unrepresented areas. 4.3.3Composite LPG Cylinder Company revisited the design and processes with the assistance from its consultant in The Czech Republic to overcome the minor technical hick ups going unnoticed in the process and have updated component design and improved the processes following Poka-yoke system not only to have better product but also to optimize the costs.

Company’s long term customer from Korea continued purchasing the cylinders and is making arrangements with retail companies for a bigger engagement. The Company is following up with Government and local Oil Companies to introduce composite LPG cylinders in domestic market. The Company addressed and settled the issues regarding the complaints of Composite cylinders from Bangladesh during the financial year. Newly designed product samples sent to customer at Bangladesh have been successfully tested and meets the required parameters. Company expects good business volume from this customer during the current year. 4.4 PACKAGING PRODUCTS 4.4.1 PACKAGING FILMS Performance Films Division (PFD) The Performance Films Division has recorded 15% growth in Volume and about 13% growth in Value. The Total sale achieved was 7722 MT as against 6703 MT in the last year. Last year’s expansion in capacity at the Company’s existing location in Khopoli has supported to overcome the de growth. The Company’s CI Flexographic Printing press has given more opportunity for the division in several Segments which has led to increase sales as well. Both the new equipment’s helped Company to deliver better quality of products and to improve its lead times due to the increase in flexibility of production capabilities. The addition of lamination unit, has enabled the Division to grow in many untapped markets/Industry/Applications. This also helped the Company in creating value added products to its portfolio. Exports have also grown at 1451 tons as against 1316 tons in the previous year. There has been some additional demand from Essential Product like Dairy Industry & Edible OIL which is the major Driver of Growth. The Company remains optimistic in the current year. Even though the Lock down will have some impact on overall business in first quarter of this year. However, the customer base will be sustained and growing due to Company’s quality, commitment and service. The Company expects to achieve volume and value growth in this business in the current year due to increase in customer base in India and abroad. This has been made possible due to increase in the production capacity with improved product mix. 4.4.2 Protective packaging division (PPD) PPD has recorded de-growth of about 4% in value and 1% in volume during the year under review. The total sale achieved 25,660 MT against 26,018 MT of last year. Due to outbreak of Covid-19 and lockdown, Sale in Feb and March affected. The last week of March was a total wash out. If all was ok, we would have achieved sale as per last year in value with 3% Growth in volume. Jadcherla unit is now ready to start its commercial production immediately after the opening up post Covid 19 with an EPE plant saleable capacity of 3200 MTPA and ABF saleable capacity of 1440 MTPA. Also the division has installed conversion equipment for processing of crosslink foam blocks and other fabrication equipment to ensure quick services to the local customers. In view of the present scenario, we expect sales to stabilize in second quarter, but would take time to utilize full capacity. Hosur unit with all its new facilities and expansions, is now fully stabilized for smooth operations with projected saleable capacities The Division is working on major cost reduction, utilization of its cross linked scrap & development of several new products. As a result the Company expects an impetus to the growth of cross linked foams across the country. It shall consider expansions of these products once the Company achieves over 90% utilisation. The Company expects to achieve this by the last quarter of this financial year. Special initiative was taken during the year for energy conservation by using alternate source of power. Major cost savings have been achieved during the year by using roof top solar panels, windmills & also buying alternate energy at all it’s manufacturing locations. Division is expecting good saving in fuel cost after installation of dry steam IBR boiler at Hosur unit as against conventional small multiple non IBR boilers. By observing the cost benefits, division is considering now to replace the old non IBR boiler at Malanpur unit & shall implement the same soon. Protection to environment against plastic wastes is high priority for the division. In house R&D team and the technical experts are working to develop new technology for converting the plastic wastes to application oriented products. Increase in productivity from the existing equipments through technological upgradation is another focused area for the division in the coming year. All units are working for reduction of product costs and other expenditure to build more competitiveness in the market to counter local & unorganised players. PACKAGING – Packaging vertical had a degrowth 8% in value and 7.1% in volume as against last year. While absolute volume of sheets & rolls did not show a decline, tonnage growth was negative in view of density reduction achieved over the last year. The division has decided to modify the existing single screw extruder at Urse with newly developed technology to produce low density EPE foam which is in demand in West zone. Due to Covid-19 delay, the Company expects this to be in place by the end of second quarter. The demand of EVA based skin friendly non-toxic certified grade Yoga mat is now increasing against Chinese NBR PVC THE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED 36 Foam Yoga mat. In-house technical team has designed and developed several types of mats to meet the requirement of different segments. The production of Interlock mat started two years ago, Initially it was difficult to compete against Chinese products. R&D team has successfully developed multiple variants of interlock mats for sports and general purpose use. Kabaddi Association of India has already started using this product and the division is expecting good business growth during the coming year. The technical team is working for further cost reduction to remain competitive. CIVIL Civil business degrowth was 11.4% in value and 9.8% in volume in current year. BIS certification has helped to capture business in major government projects during the year. Dura floor protector which was developed by the division by using Silpaulin and EPE foam, is growing and expecting further growth in the coming year. In many projects, low cost inferior quality products are used in expansion joints at cheaper prices.

Post Covid-19, the division has made a revised plan of further cost reduction & increased introduction of new products to improve profitability 4.4.3 CROSS LAMINATED FILM The Business of Cross Laminated Film & Products had a degrowth of 13.11% in volume terms mainly due to significantly lower business in the month of March 2020. The nationwide lockdown has completely disrupted the demand supply chain. Company’s plants have become operational after a gap of over one month. The Government granted partial relaxation from lockdown w.e.f. 20th April 2020. However running plant at full capacity is still a distant reality due to paucity of workers as several workers have left the work place due to prolonged lockdown. The main product of the company i.e tarpaulin is seasonal in nature with peak season between March to June. The disruption in demand supply chain with movement restrictions in place due to COVID-19 pandemic has affected business in April 2020. This will have some adverse impact on the Company’s business in the first quarter. The good news is that the demand for company’s product has started picking up and is expected to improve further once more economic activities are opened during lockdown. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted a normal monsoon in the year 2020 spelling some cheer to the agricultural sector amid the COVID-19 lockdown.

3,,". Management Discussion and Analysis 1. OVERVIEW The year under review was the toughest in the history of the Company. It started with an extreme negative outlook. The Company had to keep operations of its 24 plants’ closed for most part of the month of April 2020 and could begin in a gradual manner from last week of April onwards complying the prescribed guidelines. In the last 10 days, just before the closing of the year, the business has again witnessed tough situation as Covid – 19 second wave started affecting the general public with alarming speed. The situation has become further volatile due to steep increase in Polymer prices. The increase in prices of PVC was steepest. In the last 40 years, international prices of PVC have never reached to the levels seen in April 2021 especially in India, some other Latin American countries and Turkey. The Company however has come out of these two extreme adverse situations with unparalleled performance where the profit of the Company was highest in its 79 years of operations. This was partly supported by more than R 200 crores inventory gain on account of raw material price increase which accrued in its operations for the year. The Company’s focus remained to penetrate maximum Tehsils with larger base of retailers to have its goods reach to the customers with ease and in a most economical manner. The business in most of the segments of the Company starting from June 2020 remained positive, barring in the month of July 2020, where regional lock down in some parts of the Country affected smooth operations.

There are now more than 35,900 retailers connected with Piping System Business on regular basis. FlameGuard CPVC pipe system made by the Company is considered as a very safe material for the use in fire sprinkler system in many parts of the country. Unlike plumbing system, a fire sprinkler system requires multiple approvals. In last financial year Karnataka issued approval order for the use of CPVC system in fire sprinkler system. This will help to promote the system in Karnataka market. The approvals are also obtained from Pune and KalyanDombivali Municipal Corporations. In Gujarat the use of the system has started in Ahmedabad, Rajkot and Mehsana towns. Higher cost of the system is still a major concern. To bring down the cost company has started manufacturing the compound locally and supply of locally made fittings in India. THE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED 33 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021 The cost of the GI pipes for fire sprinkler has shown steep increase and the price gap between metal and CPVC system has reduced considerably. The system has limited success in a part of the country where MS pipe is still considered as material for installation in sprinkler system instead of GI pipe. The cost of the MS pipe is approximately 20-25% less compared to GI pipe system. The revision of the Indian standards for this system is in stage of finalisation and are expected to be published in this FY 21-22. Real boost for the CPVC sprinkler system business is expected only after all standards are in place. Product installation training for this system is a mandatory requirement before the actual installation starts to avoid hiccups. The Company provides the technical support by providing the Bill of Quantities (BOQ) from the sprinkler layout of the project. The Company also offers full support to the installer including the value engineering to reduce the cost without compromising the quality of the installation. To support environment concern, Company is gearing up to meet with National Green Tribunal directive of phasing out Lead stabilizers from manufacturing of different types of uPVC Pipes. The Company has already started using lead free stabilisers in certain piping system. In other system a schedule has been drawn to phase out lead stabilisers. 4.2 CONSUMER PRODUCTS 4.2.1 FURNITURE The Company’s furniture business declined by 5% in value terms over last year and 10% in volume terms due to lockdown which had a severe impact on the furniture business for 1st Quarter. The sales of 1st Quarter declined by a steep 70% over last year same period. However, the business started picking up from 2nd quarter and showed growth only from 3rd quarter onwards. Furniture demand was adversely affected due to pandemic restrictions as a large part of furniture sales come from Schools, Colleges, Hotels, Restaurants, Decorators, Marriage Places etc and this segment had a severe impact on their business due to the pandemic. Even the Govt buying for furniture was restricted as the focus was on healthcare and most of the funds were diverted for the same. Some of the key markets remained partially closed during the 2nd & 3rd quarter with restricted activities. However, the Company could achieve similar sales in 2nd quarter as last year same period and had good growth in 3rd & 4th quarter indicating signs of growth for 2021-22. The Company manufactures furniture made with all three different processes i.e Injection Moulding, Blow Moulding & Roto Moulding. The company has been manufacturing Injection Moulded furniture for 30 years and is a market leader in terms of it’s wide range & quality. Currently, the company manufactures injection moulded furniture at 6 locations viz Pondicherry (UT), Durgapur ( West Bengal), Guwahati (Assam), Gadegaon (Maharashtra), Lalru (Punjab) & Jadcherla (Telangana) to cater to customers effectively in different parts of the country. The Company’s Jadcherla plant is now well established and will be able to cater to adjoining markets cost efficiently. During the year, the Company’s sale of Blow Moulded table range grew by 24% over last year driven by good demand of compact folding tables for ‘Work From Home’ and sales through E-commerce. The company’s range of Blow Moulded tables is now well established and poised for good growth. The company’s plan for adding 2 new models in this segment was delayed due to pandemic and are likely to be introduced in first half of 2021-22. The Company had started manufacture of Roto Moulded Furniture in Feb 2020 and thereafter due to lockdown this segment could not be properly marketed as Kindergarten Schools which is one of the largest customers of the product launched were closed all through the year due to the pandemic. The Company plans to launch variety of models in Roto Moulded Furniture catering to different segments and is in the process of identifying suitable furniture which can be made through Roto Moulding. The Company introduced 5 new models during the year and all the models introduced were unique and cater to premium segment. Out of the 5 new models, 4 models were introduced with Gas Injection moulding technology using glass reinforced polymers. All these models are unique in their design, shape and usage. All the new models have been very well received and hope to give good growth in the coming year. The company plans to launch another 5 new models during the first half of 2021-22 which will help in overall growth in the coming year. The Company is committed to make available its furniture across India and is aggressively working towards increasing its retail penetration. The Company currently has 13,650 retailers selling its furniture who are serviced through our network of 1,251 channel partners. The Company plans to add 1,400 retail outlets during the year. The Company has identified some of its weak markets and has planned to intensify the marketing activity in those markets for improving its retail penetration and increasing the number of channel partners in these markets. The Company’s furniture range is sold on various e commerce portals through a few dedicated channel partners. It grew by 100% during the year and the biggest spurt in sales was seen post lockdown when the markets were not fully functional and most of the people were operating from home. The consumer behaviour during the year showed a major shift towards online shopping and the company along with its channel partners geared up its infrastructure to meet the sudden rising demand. The company is focused on increasing its online presence and product offerings and sees this as a future growth driver. The company’s export business grew by 27% over last year in spite of very high shipping costs, low availability of containers and overall increase in freight costs . The growth was majorly attributed to acceptance of our product by a leading retailer from USA as well as middle east. The company will continue to focus on acquiring more customers and already in dialogue with some other leading retailers. However, due to very steep increase in sea freights and furniture being a voluminous item, the retailers are holding on to their decision for the time being. The recent spate of increase in Covid cases across India amid restrictions and partial lockdowns have thrown up new challenges and the company will plan to overcome these challenges to ensure business growth in 21-22. 4.3 INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS 4.3.1 INDUSTRIAL COMPONENTS The year 2020-21 started with already imposed country wide lockdown for containment of Covid-19 Pandemic. Obviously, there was no good news on economic front. The Division mainly caters to Appliance and Automotive sectors and both these sectors not being Priority or Essential category, were not given any relaxation, thereby, these sectors were badly affected during first quarter with negligible sales revenue. Although, from latter part of May’20, relaxations in lockdown were gradually eased in phased manner, it took long time to stabilize the Supply Chain of our customers, resulting in 34 THE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021 massive de-growth of nearly 40% in both Value and Volume terms, during first half of the financial year. Company decided to use this period to carry out all round improvements in the area of Productivity, Quality, Cost Reduction and People development. The No Production/Low Production period was utilized to educate team members on World Class Management Practices, Lean Manufacturing, Training on identified Skill Gaps, Soft Skills etc by series of Virtual Learning Programs, both by the Internal and External Faculties. Team members from both Staff and Associate category from various plants of the Division were involved in this exercise during this period. This training helped company to launch Cost Management Project, code named “Rainbow Project” for focused cost reduction. Strategy was made and its implementation started to develop new businesses to improve Capacity Utilization of certain underutilized Machines and Equipment. All these actions started yielding results when demand recovery started during second half of the year. Recovery started during 3rd Quarter and got further accelerated in 4th Quarter. The recoveries in various sectors of Appliances like Washing Machines, Air Conditioners, Coolers and Refrigerators, segments where company has good presence, boosted the revenue during second half of the year. Demand recovery in Auto sector also helped Division for revenue growth with significant demand up stick in all the Segments of company’s presence like Passenger Vehicles, Two Wheelers and Commercial Vehicles. This resulted in overall growth for the year. The Division posted decent growth, both in Value and Volume term at over 11% and 6% respectively during FY 20-21 over FY 19-20. Until second half of March’21, the Outlook for FY 21-22 was looking bright with the momentum which had already picked up in Q4 of FY 20-21. Things have become uncertain within a month with huge surge in Covid caseload in the country necessitating to put across stringent curbs by various state Govts. As it stands in short term, the situation is not very clear on Business outlook. However, company feels that Business scenario remains bullish in medium and long term with business friendly policies by the Govt. Company has planned need based Capacity Augmentation to handle the projected increased demand going forward. The new machines being planned are with the latest Technology, Energy efficient, and Robust Design for Excellent Quality and Repeatability. Company is also working on cost efficient Automation. Overall rating of the company by its Customers meets or exceeds their expectations and the company is considered as one the most reliable suppliers in its area of expertise by the customers. This has helped the Division to get extra business from its customers whenever other suppliers failed to supply. Division is continuously striving to excel in all Operational Parameters as its culture. It helps company to remain cost efficient in this fiercely competitive supply chain to OEM Customers. 4.3.2 Material Handling Products The financial year began amid chaos, confusion and uncertainty. The most contributing sectors to this Material Handling Division were not operational due to lock down. The division took an aggressive approach and started focusing on sectors which were open under essential commodities, retail, FMCG etc. The efforts made in the initial periods of lock down paid off immensely as a result, the Division has grown by 12% in volume and 10% in revenue terms. The most heartening things have been the performance in sectors where the division was not doing well in the past. Analysing the performance with deeper insights, the Division has done exceptionally well in industrial sectors, like Automobile, Engineering Consumer durables in later half of the year when majority of our users increased their production to meet the pent up demand due to lock down. This resulted in improved volume of Industrial Crates and Injection Pallets. The demand for one time Cargo Pallets was all time high due to increased exports by our customers. The Company is confident this trend to continue in next year as well. As expressed earlier, the focused efforts in F & V, e-commerce, retail and FMCG to counter the negative effects of lockdown paid handsomely to your company and the division has grown phenomenally in F & V sector by over 38% over last year. Company also benefited due to inability of small players to keep up their supplies in the market. Company hopes to maintain increased share in this segment in the next year. Company keeps strong focus on Fisheries Jumbo Crates. For last few years, Company has been aggressively working to gain the market shares in Fisheries Jumbo Crates. This year there has been a growth of 20%. Aggressive efforts will continue in this sector and for that the Company has started production of Jumbo Crates at it’s Jadcherla Unit in this year. The Company’s business to Dairy segment continues to be in good shape but without growth. The Company’s crate quality is well established and appreciated by it’s customers. The Company is confident of a good growth next year. The Roto moulded Crates and Dustbins have seen decline this year. There has been good demand for Injection moulded Dustbins by Institutions and Corporates. Encouraged by this, Company has decided to introduce many new models of Dustbins in the next year. The Company also plans to introduce new models in Pallets, Crates and Ice boxes in Roto Moulding. The Company explored opportunities for export of it’s Crates, Pallets, Silpack etc. The Company has achieved reasonable success and Company will aggressively pursue to further enhance exports in the current Year. The Company is reputed for its high quality products and timely supplies which helps it to retain it’s top customers. With increased demand, the Division is augmenting its production capacities by expansion at it’s Lalru and Gadegaon Units for Crates and at Gadegaon for pallets with new models. The Company has not only retained its regular customers but has also been able to increase numbers of customers who are patronizing Company’s products regularly. The Company has opened Fabrication facility at Chennai which is functional and serving the Automobile and Industrial sector customers in vicinity of Chennai timely and efficiently hoping to double its turnover next year. The Company was not able to augment it’s Channel Network and widen it’s reach this year but aims to add across India more than 10% new partners in existing Channel Network in the current year. 4.3.3 Composite LPG Cylinder The updated component design and improved plant processes following Poka-yoke system have yielded excellent results with no customer complaints received since Q3 2019. Repeated orders from multiple existing as well as new customers stood testimony to the excellent quality of the current product offering. The Company continued its current business in Maldives and Somalia. New customer footprints have now been established in Western & Central Africa, Taiwan and the Caribbean islands. THE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED 35 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021 Composite Cylinders fall under direct sales category. New customers could not visit India because of restrictions in travel due to Covid-19 which hampered our sales volume. There was no progress in South Korean business as representatives of Korean Inspection Agency could not visit India. Our customer is setting up Testing Facility in Korea so that Korean Inspectors visit to India for quality checks will be obviated. Owing to the very high rejections of steel cylinders on account of human safety issues, marketing reports have forecasted a very bright future for composite LPG cylinders in Korea. The Company expects good business in current year after restrictions on travel eases. The largest Indian Oil Marketing Company, M/s Indian Oil Corporation Limited, purchased small quantity of Composite Cylinders in March 2021 for marketing trials in 4 cities of India. This augurs well for the long awaited introduction of Composite Cylinders in Indian market. Owing to the various favourable developments, the overall prospects for Composite Cylinders in the current year are significantly more promising for the Company. 4.4 PACKAGING PRODUCTS 4.4.1 PACKAGING FILMS Performance Films Division (PFD) The Performance Films Division has recorded 1.5% growth in Volume. The Total sale achieved was 7,816 MT as against 7,722 MT in the last year. The Domestic markets, had a growth of around 15%, particularly in the dairy & oil industry. The addition of New Value added Product in Dairy industry with the Lamination capability has enabled the Division to grow in many different applications. This also helped the Company in adding value added products to its portfolio. Continuous efforts to develop new products will help the division grow better this year Exports have declined. Sales were only 1,343 tons as against 1,451 tons in the previous year, mostly because of the Covid situation all over. Till travel becomes normal, there may not be good growth in exports. However the division is committed to work on building its export portfolio. The customer base will be sustained and further enlarged well supported by Company’s quality, commitment and service. The Company remains optimistic in the current year in spite of challenging times and environment. With available production capacity, improved product mix and focus on increasing customer base, the Company expects to achieve volume and value growth in this business in the current year. 4.4.2 Protective packaging division (PPD) PPD Sales turnover was 3.2% lower at R 530 Crs in FY2020-21 vs. R 547.50 Crs in FY2019-20. Volume was lower by 7.6%. COVID played a spoiler in QI & part QII of last year but a consolidated team effort across functions in Sales/Marketing & Manufacturing & improved demand, the division was able to recover some lost ground in QIII & QIV. Packaging Packaging vertical had de-growth of 2.3% in value with business of R 395 Crs in current year as against R 404.50 Crs last year and had de-growth of 8% in volume. Several new packaging applications were developed, resulting in a smart increase of business in fabricated products with increase value addition. This augurs well in the coming year Civil Civil business had a growth of 4.4% in value with sales of R 56 Crs in current year as against R 53.70 Crs last year. Volume growth was 9% primarily due to export of civil products which clocked a growth of 140%. This is expected to further increase, as Company’s products find greater acceptance in several international markets. Insulation Insulation business had a de-growth of 19% value with Business of R 65.89 Crs this year against R 81.17 Crs. in the previous year. CPD / Retail Division Several new variants of yoga mats were introduced this year. Along with an ever increasing network, CPD achieved a sale R 10.57 Crs @160% growth for FY2020-21 as against R 4.08 Crs for FY2019-20. Company’s FITSPREE brand of Yoga mats and allied products have been well accepted. The division added 74 new distributors & 3020 new retailers in the year under review. Moreover, the division started doing business with CPC (Central Police Canteen) and also expect to get an initial breakthrough with Canteen Stores department (CSD) with 4 products approvals. Exports From R 12.29 Crs exports last year, Division achieved exports of R 18.88 Crs. The Division has developed & is developing several new products for the export market. With the development of several new products, the Company expects significant growth in exports during 2021-22. MANUFACTURING, INNOVATION & TECHNOLOGY Manufacturing Jadcherla: The plant started its commercial production from July’ 2020 onwards. Capacity utilisation has been 50% in the 9 months till March 2021. The Company expects to touch 70% utilisation in the current year & over 80% thereafter. Hosur: With the unit now well established, it is working on further improving its operational efficiencies. Several new products, have been introduced by the unit. This will create new export opportunities, besides increasing domestic business. This will further improve capacity utilisation in the coming year. Fabrication facilities are being adequately upgraded to offer cost effective solutions & wider range of products to our customers Urse-2 plant (fabrication facility) is certified with SEDEX 4 pillar. A prerequisite for some of the export products. The same was renewed last year. Innovation The design of single screw foam extruder of 300 kg/hrs capacity in Urse plant has been modified with a unique screw design which has resulted in a 14.5% higher production capacity and also density reduction comparable with the latest version of Tandem Extruder which are installed at other units. Through re-engineering by R&D team, the productivity of all foam extruders and lamination plants has been increased over the original equipment design capacity. The overall product density has been reduced by 0.5 kg/m3 without deteriorating the quality standards, which has resulted to material savings. All the units are working further for the reduction of density. Through technological up-gradation, the existing crosslink extruded foam for Insulation application has been modified with reduced density matching the specified values as per BS 476 for Class 1 and Class 0. 36 THE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021 By incorporating some design changes in the equipment of NBR plant of Malanpur, the unit has achieved 20% higher production in sheets, enabling it to be more competitive in the market. The unit is also working on improving output of tubes in a similar manner. TPE Yoga mats have been developed as an import substitute and has been well received in the market. These products would also create additional export opportunities. Technology The Company has been granted a patent (Patent no. 347416, A Manufacturing process for block foam) for its innovative method of recycling the non-recyclable crosslink waste which, in-general, cannot be converted with conventional methods. This has enabled us to use our own cross linked wastage in larger quantities. As a result, Crosslink block foam variants have been developed with 65% recycle material (cross linked waste). This product is well accepted for some heavy duty packaging applications. Now R&D team is working on developing several new products by using high volume of recycled material. These are expected to be launched this year. The Company hopes to achieve almost zero sale of it’s cross linked scrap in time to come. The Hot-melt Glue Adhesive coating machine has been modified from its original design for the use of the multipurpose usage as required which has enhanced our ability to make multiple products with significant cost savings. The technical team reengineered the 2 stage block foam line resulting in increased productivity of 17% & wastage reduction by 5% New Initiatives New variant of interlock mat for various sports applications has been developed at Hosur by using recycled material which has facilitated to counter Chinese imports. The Company expects good business in the coming year The division is working hard to use alternate energy sources like the solar & wind. Significant savings of the power cost have been achieved at Hosur unit and the process will be replicated at other units also during the current year. While the new year has begun with Covid-19 raring its serpentine head again, The Company believes that, with all measures taken by the Company, this year would be a good one for the division. 4.4.3 CROSS LAMINATED FILM The Business of Cross Laminated Film & Products recorded an impressive growth of 28.50% in volume terms despite challenging conditions posed by COVID-19 pandemic. The company lost sales of almost whole of April, 2020 due to lockdown but came back strongly to post remarkable growth in sales at the backdrop of robust demand for its products. The growth in demand was due to intensive market penetration by adding new channel partners and retailers, timely supplies, and introduction of additional varieties in made up products and boost in export volume. The healthy order book at year end suggests the growth in demand will continue. To cater to the growing demand prospect, the Company has taken steps to expand the capacity from 27,000 MT to 30,000 MT per annum. The Company has already received some equipment and the balance will come during the current year. Increased capacity will be fully operational by January 2022. As per weather forecast by SKYMET the monsoon in India is predicted to be normal with no La Nina scare. This will boost the demand for company’s products in the coming year. The sale of made up products has grown during the year. The Company expects the demand for made up products to grow and so has put up a new fabrication facility at Halol exclusively for production of these products. The Company has soft launched Bio-floc fish tanks in eleven States. There were some technical issues in those tanks. They are now being addressed. The Company will relaunch this product only after addressing those technical issues which must add value to it’s customers. The Company’s economy model of tarpaulin under the brand name “Supreme Sathi” is well established in the low cost Tarpaulin segment. The same is available from it’s generated reprocess granules. The division’s exports posted a strong growth of 35% up from 1183 MT to 1600 MT in the year. The thrust in coming year in exports will be mainly on developing newer applications, entering new markets and targeting chain stores and super markets for sale through their online portals. The Company expects the exports to grow further in the coming year. The intermittent lock down in the European countries completely derailed the preparation of drawings of various equipment required to put up the Cross Plastic Film project. The project will be taken in hand only after detailed drawings are ready. The implementation of that project is thus delayed. 5. FINANCE 1. A brief on borrowing levels and finance cost is given below :- 1.1 Summary Particulars Measure F.Y. 2020-21 F.Y. 2019-20 Net borrowing level at the end of the year R in crores Surplus of 759.46 216.42 Average Monthly Borrowings R in crores Surplus of 247.94 205.02 Interest & finance charges R in crores 9.50 20.18 Average cost of borrowings at the end of the year % p.a.

4,,". Management Discussion and Analysis 1. OVERVIEW The year began on a gloomy note with the second wave of Covid which affected the economy in general and the rural economy in particular, in a very severe way. The first quarter of the year which normally remains most business friendly for the Company (considering its product profile) witnessed quite a weak demand for most of the product segments of the Company. Thereafter, Polymer prices witnessed relentless upward march which continued up to middle of November 2021. Subsequently, prices fell quite steeply (especially in PVC Resin) which virtually destroyed the demand of Plastic Pipe Systems albeit temporarily. Even in such extreme adverse circumstances, the Company managed to recover large quantum of its lost business and achieved substantially better business in remaining part of the year. (compared to preceding previous year) in most of the segments in which it operates. Covid-19 pandemic was very effectively contained by the Central & State Governments with effective vaccination drive and local lockdowns, while largely enforcing Covid appropriate behavior. This has galvanised the economy on growth path. It was further supported by normal monsoon resulting in improved agricultural production. Despite the hostile & adverse environment, Company maintained a positive outlook for its growth plans. It persisted with its large investment plan with full confidence that business will be quite promising in the year 2022-23 and beyond. The expectations are proving to be realistic. This is further supported by softening of the upward trend of Plastic raw material prices. From the start of the year beginning April 2022, the Polymer prices have started downward trend. Company sold 4,11,521 tons product in the year 2019-20. Thereafter, in subsequent two years, the volumes continued downward trend reaching a low of 3,93,908 tons in the year 2021-22. The Company is confident that in the current year (2022-23) Company will be able to achieve good business volume and growth over pre-covid level achieved in the year 2019-20. Most of the business segments are now showing improved demand prospects. The Composite LPG Cylinder division which was formed in the year 2014 was languishing up to end of March 2021. However during the year under review, this division started utilizing its capacity effectively and has now firmed up its expansion plan to double the installed capacity. Thus, the Company is now actively present in thermoset section of Plastics, which augurs well for the further growth plans in this section of business. The Company continues with its investment plans vigorously which may exceed the Capex plan of 2021-22. The Company envisages good business growth opportunities in all its segments going forward as the impact of pandemic has ebbed and several initiatives are being taken by the Government to put the Country on higher growth path. 2.

COMPANY STRENGTH AND GROWTH DRIVERS 3.1 Manufacturing Sites The Company is operating from 25 manufacturing sites across 12 States and Union Territories. The Company has taken up of Three Green Field Projects primarily for Plastics Piping System in the States of Assam, Odisha and Tamil Nadu. Same are likely to be in operation during first half of current year. 3.2 Distribution Network The Company is committed to reach to all the Tehsil areas of the Country. The Company has been able to create Dealer network in hundreds of Tehsils during the year, where Company’s products are either not there or having very marginal reach. The Company’s active Channels Partners strength increased to 4053 Nos in March 2022. Global markets have started opening up, enabling the Company to reach to the overseas customers. The Company has started participating in various national and international exhibitions, frequency of which is expected to further increase going forward. The Company continues to open more Depots to service its customers in a cost efficient manner. The Company has total 36 Depots and Fabrication facilities for its various product groups. 3.3 Growth Drivers The Company’s spend on TV advertisement at regional and national level and in various sports events being telecast apart from use of diverse modes of media during the year has strengthened its Brand further. Participation in various national & international exhibitions has again started. The Company has conducted large nos. of plumber meets to educate them about new piping products, proper application techniques etc . The same has been well appreciated by the plumbing community and they have expressed their desire for more such events to be organised on regular basis. Knowledge centers opened by the Company are playing a pivotal role in providing knowledge about new products/ applications and able to create awareness among architects, contractors, farmers, plumbers and channel partners. Unfortunately counterfeit products are being introduced by some unscrupulous players in a large way in the Pipe Segment, Cross Laminated film and Furniture product segments. The Company is quite active in seeking legal remedy to protect the consumers from getting cheated. The Company has been largely successful in containing this menace which however appears to be a recurring problem area. 3.4 Renewable Energy - a way forward The Company is committed and has taken very focused steps to ensure that it uses more and more green and renewal energy and becomes more environmental friendly. Roof top solar capacity of the Company has almost doubled from 8.61 Mwp FY(20-21) to 17.09 Mwp during the year FY(21-22) i.e. increase of 8.480 Mwp successfully commissioned at various units. Further commissioning of 6.22 Mwp Roof Top Solar Power is in progress at various units & shall become operational in April/ May 2022. Company also signed PPA of 3.5 Mwp Group Captive Solar Power for its units in U.P. which is likely to be operational by September, 2022. Company is also using and exploring ways to increase uses of wind energy. During the year 102.84 Lakh wind units were consumed by different units across India which constitutes 3.85% of Company’s total energy consumption. Further, Company also signed PPA of 70 Lakh Hybrid Units PA for its two units located at Halol in Gujarat. Company plans to further invest about R 40 Crs. during the year for Solar energy installations and would also increase usage of renewable energy sources through open access/Group Captive or apex mode. During the year Company could achieve usage of about 12% of its total energy consumption through renewable energy sources and it aims to achieve 20% target by end of financial year 2022-23. The Company aspires to be carbon neutral at the earliest feasible and would pursue this vision in a focussed manner by taking various effective steps and allocating more resources. 4. OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE 4.1 PLASTICS PIPING SYSTEMS The Company continues its objective to aggressively grow Plastic Pipe System business where the Company is a leader in the segment as it has the largest portfolio of products, which is being continuously expanded to offer more systems as required by the market it caters to. During the year under review the Company registered an overall revenue growth of about 24.6% in Plastic Piping System made from different plastic materials. Overall the Company sold 274295 Tons of Pipe System compared to 294357 Tons in the preceding year. In the year under review the spread of corona pandemic was more pronounced in rural areas and consequently the AGRI business was affected adversely especially during the months of April’21 and May’21. Since the AGRI business is of large volumes and seasonal, the loss could not be recouped during the off-season period, when there is low demand for this application. This has led to de-growth in volumes for the full year. PVC is the predominant raw material in the Company’s Plastic Pipe business. During the year 21-22 the prices of PVC were literally in roller coaster mode. The prices of PVC were in upward trend from 16th March 2021 till middle of May 2021. Overall prices of PVC went up by R 16/- per kg during that period. Thereafter from 1st June ’21 prices of PVC started decreasing till up to July’ 2021 and the fall was close to R 10/- per kg. Thereafter from 1st August’21 onwards the prices of PVC kept increasing till middle of November’21. Overall prices of PVC went up by R 42/- per kg during that period. Thereafter again the prices of PVC started falling and the prices decreased by approx. R 29/- per kg up to beginning February’22. This has affected the market sentiment and led to de-growth by around 6.9% in volume for the year. The Government at the Centre and States have put the priority focus on Jal Jeevan Mission (To provide tap connections to every household), Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Housing for all), AMRUT, Swatch Bharat Abhiyan, Sanitation and affordable houses to all and development of 100 smart cities on all India basis. NITI Aayog has declared following as growth drivers across the country: THE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED 35 ANNUAL REPORT 2021-2022 •	 Government infrastructure spending •	 Increasing construction •	 Increasing Industrial production •	 Rising demand from irrigation sector •	 Replacement of aging Pipes •	 Providing affordable house to all •	 Heavy investment by Government in irrigation, housing and sanitization Almost all the above growth initiatives will give a boost to the business of Plastic Piping System Division. Real Estate Regulation Act (RERA) has transformed the way housing sector business is conducted in the Country. Many prominent Business Houses have announced ambitious plans in this sector to grow geometrically with launch of their projects at multiple locations. For affordable housing segment the Company has introduced customer friendly drainage system under the different brand name “Streamline” which meets all functional requirements of the affordable Housing sector.
