part_0: The Indian economy has undergone significant structural reforms in the last seventeen months, including the introduction of Goods and Service Tax (GST) which has integrated the country's economy and reduced the incidence of indirect tax on most products. The streamlining of GST implementation and tax rates took some time, causing upheaval in the first half of last year. The introduction of the Realty Estate Regulation Act (RERA) also affected growth in the piping business in the housing sector for several months. However, initiatives taken by the government to boost rural income and infrastructure are now fructifying, which is expected to boost business in several segments. The company expects a faster growth in business from April 2018 and beyond, and has committed larger investments than planned at the beginning of the year. Polymer prices have hardened, and the PVC price trend is expected to remain on the higher side in 2018-19. The company expects business conditions to be favorable in the year, and plans to put two new Greenfield plants in production this year, with two more planned for next year. The company's product groups have been recast as Plastics, Piping, and System, with a range of products including uPVC pipes, HDPE pipe systems, and inspection.

The company intends to start working on two new sites to put up plants in the current year.
part_2: The company participated in several exhibitions in India and internationally last year and is taking legal action to combat counterfeit products in plastics pipe systems, XF products, and furniture. The company aims to grow in the plastic pipe system business, which is expected to see a shift from unorganized to organized players due to the introduction of the GST regime. The company registered an overall revenue growth of 10% in plastic piping systems made from different plastic materials, selling 2,56,330 tons of pipe system compared to 2,35,256 tons in the same period of the previous year. However, growth was not up to the company's expectations due to the introduction of GST and the Real Estate Regulation Act (RERA), which slowed down demand from the housing sector. The company incurred a Capex of R 144 crore to build more capacities and increase product range. The company is also expanding its manufacturing footprint in South Zone and has entered into an MOU with the State Government of Andhra Pradesh to put up a project in Nellore district. The plant at Kharagpur is fully operational, and the company is exploring further capacity increases for HDPE pipes. To meet the increasing demand for HDPE pipes in North India, the company is putting up capacity in Malanpur Unit No.3. Another Roto Moulding plant is now operational.

Although the company's CPVC Fire Sprinkler System is approved by Bureau of Indian Standard (BIS) and is also Underwriters Laboratories (UL) listed, the company still needs product approval to install in Residential/Commercial Buildings.
part_4: The text discusses the slow growth of CPVC Fire Sprinkler System in India due to the lack of standardization and implementation. The company is making efforts to create awareness about its products and has successfully installed the system in Mumbai, Pune, and Goa.

The company is also participating in various exhibitions to promote its brand and has received good response from Indian and overseas buyers. In addition, the company is phasing out Lead stabilizers from manufacturing of different types of u PVC Pipes to support environmental concerns. 

In the consumer products segment, the company's furniture business had a good growth of 11% on value terms and 8% on volume terms, outpacing the overall Plastic Furniture Industry growth of 4% on value terms. However, the company faced initial hiccups in business with the introduction of GST and reduction in pipeline inventory with trade channels. 

Overall, the company is optimistic about the growth of its business in the current calendar year, with most regulatory approvals expected to be over and indigenous development of products to be complete. The business may catch momentum from the second half of the current financial year.
part_5: The Supreme Industries Limited, a leading player in the plastic furniture business in India, experienced a boost in growth in the second half of 2017-18 due to the reduction in GST rates from 28% to 18%.

The company currently manufactures Injection Moulded Furniture and Blow Moulded Furniture, and has 5 units across the country to cater to different regions. The company is also putting up a Green Field Plant in Telangana to increase its market share in Southern India. The company's growth is attributed to its focus on increasing its distribution set up and delivering high-quality products and services to its customers. The company's furniture is available to customers through a nationwide network of around 11,000 retailers. The company also introduced 7 new furniture models during the year, which were well appreciated by customers.

The Khushkhera plant has experienced an 8% growth in sales, with supplies established for Honda's WR-V SUV model, and development underway for other models for Maruti Suzuki and Honda. To strengthen its capabilities and become a complete source of supply, Tata Motors has entered into a joint venture with Kumi Kasei, a Japanese company, to set up Kumi Supreme India Private Limited. The joint venture will take over Khushkhera plant operations and is expected to improve the technological competence of the Auto Comp Business. The Chennai plant is running at its optimum capacity, and the company plans to expand and increase the plant's capacity to acquire future opportunities. The Pondy plant has achieved a healthy volume growth of about 40%, driven by good demand for Whirlpool washing machines. The company is taking steps to improve operations further to enhance productivity, quality, cost optimization, and skills upgrading to meet increased demand from customers and stay competitive.
part_8: The company has planned capacity and capability enhancement at its Pondy plant by taking a series of actions, including layout changes, safety improvements, and augmenting plant capacity.

part_9: The Supreme Industries Limited has shown healthy growth of 30% in their business, with customers appreciating the quality of their products.

The Injection Moulded Pallet business has achieved volume growth of 12%, and the MHD products made by Roto Moulding has shown good growth of 20% over last year. The company is planning to enhance capacity for Roto Moulded products of this Division. The Bottle crates for soft drinks did not perform well.

The performance films division was running at full capacity, and the Protective packaging division recorded 16% growth in value & 17.5% in volume during the year under review. The overall packaging business was good during the year under review. The division has taken up a challenge to build quality awareness.
part_10: The Supreme Industries Limited has commenced production in its NBR sheet plant after a delay of over four months due to delayed supply of equipment. The company expects competition to remain fierce in the coming year, but many civil projects are getting restarted, which is expected to improve demand for the DURA range of products in the current year. The market response for the new ranges of products like children education toys, sports, health sector, and interiors which were launched last year has been encouraging. The division is also developing sport-specific certified interlock mats. The acoustic range of products hasn't picked up as well as expected, but the division is expecting a good growth of business of this vertical during the year due to enhanced availability of the NBR bonded block foam. The company is expanding its production capacity at Kharagpur unit and doing the feasibility study for enhancing production capacity at Malanpur. The division has started work at the Jadcherla complex, which is being set up, and has also decided to establish more fabrication facilities including expansion of existing ones at different locations to capture high-value added fabrication business.

The cross-laminated film and products division experienced a de-growth due to the slow economy and the roll-out of GST, which caused confusion among traders. The company's main product, tarpaulin, was initially placed in the highest GST rate bracket, but after representations, the rate was reduced from 28% to 18%. The loss of sales during the first five months impacted the company's performance. The company is planning to expand cross-linked block foamed production capacity at various locations to cater to demand.
part_12: The Supreme Industries Limited, a leading plastic products manufacturer in India, experienced a decline in profits due to the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and increased raw material costs.

Everest Kanto Cylinder Ltd has acquired 10% business interest in HPC Research s.r.o., a start-up company focusing on R&D in composite cylinders in the Czech Republic, which will strengthen its R&D footprint in the field of pressure vessels. Despite the challenging times, the company has managed to reduce its overall finance cost during the year under review, on account of prudent working capital management, reliance on low-cost commercial papers and low-cost borrowings from banks, and a judicious and consistent hedging policy to mitigate the risk arising out of foreign currency fluctuations.

The maintenance of proper accounting records, compliance with laws and regulations, and safeguarding assets against loss and misappropriation will remain central to the control systems. The company considers human resources as key to its future growth strategy and is focusing on aligning human resource policies, processes, and initiatives to meet its business needs. The company provides training and learning opportunities to keep employees abreast of technological and technical developments. Industrial relations at all units and locations are cordial. The company cautions that its objectives, expectations, or predictions may be forward-looking and actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the statement.
