      "b'Management Discussion and Analysis\\r\\n1. OVERVIEW\\r\\nThere were far reaching structural reforms implemented in the\\r\\nIndian economy in the last seventeen months starting from\\r\\nNovember 2016. In the process these measures have put the\\r\\neconomy on sound growth path. They augur well to put the\\r\\neconomy in high growth mode in future.\\r\\nThe most significant reform was introduction of Goods and\\r\\nService Tax w.e.f 1.7.2017. This single measure has integrated\\r\\nthe Country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economy. Overall, the incidence of indirect tax\\r\\nhas come down on most of the products by this measure of\\r\\nmerging several indirect taxes and cess charged on the products\\r\\nin different States prior to July 2017.\\r\\nThe streamlining of GST implementation and Tax rates took\\r\\nsome time. That has created upheaval in 1st half of last year.\\r\\nFor your Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business, the introduction of Realty\\r\\nEstate regulation Act (RERA) has also affected growth of piping\\r\\nbusiness in Housing Sector for several months.\\r\\nThe several initiatives taken by Government to boost rural\\r\\nincome and infrastructure are now fructifying to boost business\\r\\nin several segments which are catered by the Company . The\\r\\nCompany, therefore, envisaged a faster growth in business\\r\\nfrom April 2018 and beyond. On the basis of the promising\\r\\nfuture demand growth, the Company started committing larger\\r\\ninvestments during the year than planned at beginning of the\\r\\nyear.\\r\\nDue to hardening of Polymer Prices and lack of new capacity\\r\\nbuild up of the PVC resin all around the world, the PVC\\r\\nprices have moved to higher band. For the year 2018-19, it is\\r\\nexpected that the PVC price trend will remain on higher side.\\r\\nIn spite of increase in Crude prices, the prices of Polythene\\r\\nwill move to a lower level over the year as several new plants\\r\\nare starting in USA based on the low feed stock cost of Shale\\r\\ngas. Overall, the polymer prices will remain affordable.\\r\\nThe effect of Demonetization , GST and RERA looks to have\\r\\nsettled down to a large extent. The economy is moving to\\r\\nformal sector slowly, but surely from informal sector. This\\r\\naugurs well to boost the economic activity in the Country. The\\r\\ninitial forecast for Monsoon this year is also normal. Company,\\r\\ntherefore, expects business conditions to be favorable in the\\r\\nyear to boost the demand for it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s products.\\r\\nThe Company expects to put two new Greenfield plants\\r\\nin production this year \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one at Telangana and another at\\r\\nRajasthan. The Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s additional construction of buildings\\r\\nin existing plants and start up of production at those sites will\\r\\nalso go in production this year at Malanpur, Khopoli, Hosur\\r\\nand Kharagpur.\\r\\nThe Company intends to start two new plants at Andhra\\r\\nPradesh and Assam. Land acquisition process has started. They\\r\\nmay partially go into production next year.\\r\\nThe Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s units to make up automobile products at\\r\\nKhuskhera has been put in JV with a Japanese Company. The\\r\\nCompany may divest it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s small holding in that Unit within 2-3\\r\\nyears after start up of this J.V\\r\\n2. PRODUCT GROUPS\\r\\nThe product groups of the Company have been recast as\\r\\nfollows:\\r\\nGroup Products\\r\\nPlastics\\r\\nPiping\\r\\nSystem\\r\\nuPVC Pipes, Injection Moulded PVC fittings and\\r\\nhandmade fittings, Polypropylene Random Copolymer\\r\\npipe system, HDPE Pipe Systems, CPVC Pipes\\r\\nSystems, Inspection Chambers, manholes, Toilets Bath\\r\\nfittings, Roto moulded Tanks and Fittings and Solvents\\r\\nConsumer\\r\\nproducts\\r\\nFurniture\\r\\nIndustrial\\r\\nProducts\\r\\nIndustrial Components, Material handling System and\\r\\nPallets \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Roto moulded crates,pallets and garbage bins\\r\\nPackaging\\r\\nProducts\\r\\nFlexible packaging film products, Protective Packaging\\r\\nProducts, Cross Laminated Film products\\r\\nComposite\\r\\nProducts\\r\\nComposite LPG Cylinders,\\r\\nPRODUCT GROUP WISE SHARE IN TURNOVER FOR\\r\\nTHE LAST TWO YEARS (% OF VALUE)\\r\\nPlastics\\r\\nPiping\\r\\nSystem\\r\\n55.66%\\r\\nComposite\\r\\nCylinders\\r\\n0.03%\\r\\nPackaging\\r\\nProducts\\r\\n20.81%\\r\\nIndustrial\\r\\nProducts\\r\\n16.32%\\r\\nConsumer\\r\\nProducts\\r\\n7.18%\\r\\n2017-18\\r\\nIndustrial Products\\r\\n14.19%\\r\\nPackaging\\r\\nProducts\\r\\n22.32%\\r\\nConsumer\\r\\nProducts\\r\\nPlastics Piping 7.17%\\r\\nSystem 56.12%\\r\\n2016-17\\r\\nComposite\\r\\nCylinders 0.20%\\r\\nThe net turnover (including other income) of the Company\\r\\nfor the year under review was R 4983.80.Crores (including\\r\\nR 65.77 Crores by way of trading in other related products\\r\\nand R 24.28 crores from sale of Premises) as against R 4469.79\\r\\ncrores (including R 64.78 Crores by way of trading in other\\r\\nrelated products ) during the previous year.\\r\\nTHE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED n 41\\r\\nThe Company has sold 3,71,176 tons of Plastic products as\\r\\nagainst 3,40,906 tons of Plastic products in the corresponding\\r\\nperiod of previous year, reflecting a growth of 9% in product\\r\\nturnover by volume.\\r\\nThe Company exported goods worth US $ 16.93 . million as\\r\\nagainst US $ 13.50 million during the corresponding period\\r\\nof the previous year.\\r\\nProfit before interest, depreciation and exceptional items and\\r\\ntaxes during the period under review have been at R 804.31\\r\\ncrores as against R 769.61 crores during the previous year.\\r\\n3. COMPANY\\xe2\\x80\\x99S STRENGTH AND GROWTH DRIVERS\\r\\n3.1 M anufacturing Sites\\r\\nThe Company is operating from 25 manufacturing sites\\r\\noperating in 11States and Union Territories. The Company\\r\\nintends to start working on two new sites to put up plant in the\\r\\ncurrent year. It is expected that the Company will be finalizing\\r\\nthe location in Andhra Pradesh and Assam during this year and\\r\\nstart activities to put up the plants.\\r\\n3.2 Distribution network\\r\\nYour Company is committed to increase its reach throughout\\r\\nthe country. To attain this objective, the Company has added\\r\\nfurther distributors in the past year. The distributors strength\\r\\nhas gone up to 3303.Nos by the end of March 2018 compared\\r\\nto 2973 nos by March 2017.\\r\\nWherever the Company could not find suitable distributors\\r\\nto buy and stock Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s products for re-distribution\\r\\nthroughout the retail chain of that area, the Company started\\r\\nselling products directly to big retailers in that area. Selectively,\\r\\nthe Company has strengthened it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supply system to service\\r\\nthose retailers in a cost efficient manner. The Company started\\r\\nthis only very selectively.\\r\\nYour Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Supreme brand is now registered with a\\r\\npunch line \\xe2\\x80\\x9c Supreme \\xe2\\x80\\x93 People who know plastics best.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n3.3 Growth Drivers\\r\\nYour Company is strengthening its brand in Two ways. One by\\r\\nincreasing expenditure on Advertisement through Electronic,\\r\\nPrint media and participating in several Exhibitions in India\\r\\nand abroad along with large meets of plumbers, Dealers,\\r\\nRetailers and Architects. The Company participated in several\\r\\nexhibitions in India and internationally last year. Secondly\\r\\nCompany is taking legal recourse to contain counterfeit\\r\\nproducts in Plastics pipe System, XF Products and Furniture.\\r\\nCompany assiduously works to address this menace.\\r\\n4. OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE\\r\\n4.1 Plastics Piping Systems\\r\\nThe Company continues its objective to grow in Plastic Pipe\\r\\nSystem business. The company is leader in this segment as it has\\r\\nthe largest portfolio of products, which is being continuously\\r\\nincreased, to offer more systems as required in the economy.\\r\\nThe introduction of GST regime in the country augured well\\r\\nfor growth of this business. There is likelihood of shift in\\r\\nbusiness from unorganized players to organized players over\\r\\nthe period. This is expected to lead to growth in the business\\r\\nof your Company in forthcoming years.\\r\\nThe Company during the year under review registered an over\\r\\nall revenue growth of 10% in Plastic Piping System made from\\r\\ndifferent plastic materials. Overall the company sold 2,56,330\\r\\nTons of Pipe System compared to 2,35,256 Tons in same period\\r\\nof last year.\\r\\nThe growth in the business was not upto Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nexpectation. GST introduction has put damper in Agri market\\r\\nrequirement in April/June. Real Estate Regulation Act (RERA)\\r\\nto regulate the Housing Sector has slowed down the demand\\r\\nfrom this sector for quite a period.\\r\\nThe Government at the Centre and States has put the priority\\r\\nfocus on Swatch Bharat Abhiyan, Sanitation and affordable\\r\\nhouses to all and development of 100 smart cities on all\\r\\nIndia basis. Real Estate Regulation Act (RERA) has created a\\r\\nmajor transformation the way housing construction for sale\\r\\nwas in vogue in the Country.

Certain states got Central Authority\\r\\ncalled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDirector Fire Services\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the approval is acceptable\\r\\nto all the Fire Officers and Fire stations within their States.\\r\\nBut in certain States the Company has to seek approval from\\r\\nevery Chief Fire Officer of a city which has status of Municipal\\r\\nCorporation. Seeking approval is a time consuming process.\\r\\nThus the growth in this segment will be slow though it is\\r\\ninternationally proven a better system than metal Fire Sprinkler\\r\\nSystem for Horizontal Application.\\r\\nThe BIS has not yet published the standard for CPVC Fire\\r\\nSprinkler Fittings and also many amendments to IS- 15105,\\r\\nwhich is a standard for design and installation of Fire Sprinkler\\r\\nSystem. Although National Building Code 2016 has been\\r\\npublished the implementation part has still not gathered pace.\\r\\nAs a result the awareness about mandatory installation of CPVC\\r\\nFire Sprinkler System in High-rise Residential Apartments as\\r\\nwell as Commercial buildings is not catching the momentum.\\r\\nThe Company is putting lot of efforts in creating awareness\\r\\nabout it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s products by meeting various Developers, Consultants\\r\\nand Installers in all the major Metropolitan and Tier-I cities.

The company faced initial hiccups in business with\\r\\nGST regime. Sales in First Quarter were extremely sluggish due\\r\\nto introduction of GST and reduction in pipeline inventory\\r\\nwith trade channels. Further, the GST rate which was kept at\\r\\n28 % in the beginning had an adverse effect on the business.\\r\\nHowever, reduction in GST rate from 28 % to 18 % gave boost\\r\\nto the business and the growth in second half of 2017-18 was\\r\\na healthy 16% on value terms. The company believes that with\\r\\nreduction in GST rate & effective compliance, the share of\\r\\norganized players should increase in overall plastic furniture\\r\\nbusiness over the period.\\r\\nThe company currently manufactures Injection Moulded\\r\\nFurniture & Blow Moulded Furniture.

The division is also working\\r\\non development of new range of civil products which are\\r\\napplication oriented and a cost effective solution to the\\r\\ncustomers.\\r\\nInsulation\\r\\nThe growth of Insulation division was 7.29% in value & 3.51%\\r\\nin volume. As informed earlier, several new competitors\\r\\nentered the business simultaneously & dropped prices\\r\\ninappropriately while compromising on desired quality\\r\\nstandards. This had severely impacted Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business &\\r\\nprofitability. However, constant efforts to sell products based\\r\\non required quality standards has started to yield results. NBR\\r\\nsheet plant will expand existing portfolio of products in this\\r\\nvertical.\\r\\nTechnology\\r\\nThe Technical team of the division has been working on\\r\\ninnovative ideas to develop new products, new applications, &\\r\\nupgrading of existing processing facilities and other segments.\\r\\nThe Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s innovative & light weight products have been\\r\\nbeneficial to industry & the society at large\\r\\nThe Indian Green Building Council ( IGBC ) has certified all of\\r\\nCompany\\xe2\\x80\\x99s insulation range of products. The division has also\\r\\nreceived 8th Plasticon Award in the category of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInnovation in\\r\\nPolymer Waste Management and Recycling Technology\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on\\r\\nthe bonded block foam.\\r\\n4.4.3 Cross Laminated Film\\r\\nThe Business of Cross Laminated film and products had a\\r\\nde-growth during the year which witnessed slow down in\\r\\neconomy in the first half due to roll out of Goods & Service\\r\\nTax (GST). Several new players have also entered this business\\r\\nin the country claiming to make similar products like our\\r\\nCompany. Combination of these two factors have affected the\\r\\nvolume & margins in this segment of business.\\r\\nPrior to launch of GST on 1st July, 2017 there was lot of\\r\\nconfusion, particularly amongst the traders, regarding eligibility\\r\\nof credit of duties paid on purchase of goods which remained\\r\\nin stock on the date of GST implementation. Most of the\\r\\ncompany\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dealers curtailed purchases to maintain stocks at\\r\\na very low level. This adversely impacted sale of company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nproducts during the first quarter of the year which are supposed\\r\\nto be the peak months for the sale of tarpaulins. In the GST\\r\\nregime, the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s main product tarpaulin was placed\\r\\ninitially in the highest rate bracket i.e. 28%. This made the\\r\\nproduct costly to the end users. After lot of representations\\r\\nat various forums the GST rate on tarpaulin was reduced\\r\\nfrom 28% to 18% but in the meantime company lost sizeable\\r\\nbusiness. Though the sales picked up from September\\r\\nonwards, the loss of sales during the first five months could\\r\\nnot be recouped.\\r\\nThere was small growth in the 35GSM Silpoly Liner business.\\r\\nThe company is promoting this product in newer applications\\r\\nwith positive response.\\r\\nAs per the prediction of India Meteorological Department\\r\\nthe 2018 monsoon is expected to be normal brightening\\r\\nthe chances of recovery in the farm sector & growth in rural\\r\\neconomy. This may boost the demand for Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s products,\\r\\nmost of which find application in agriculture sector.\\r\\nThe company is hopeful of getting increased foothold in the\\r\\nUSA market in the coming years. The company is working on\\r\\ndeveloping specialized new applications to increase the size\\r\\nof market. The company aims to bringing in new customers\\r\\nin its fold in the existing markets & reaching out new markets\\r\\nwhere at present it does not have any presence by show casing\\r\\nits products in various international exhibitions.\\r\\nWith enhanced capacity at its disposal the company has made\\r\\nCross Line (XL) Bonded Film available in almost all thicknesses.\\r\\nThis product has superior properties than the normal XF Film\\r\\n& enjoys patent protection. The company has now acquired\\r\\nall the rights in the patents of Cross Line Bonded Film from\\r\\nthe technical collaborator. This will bring in lot of savings in\\r\\nthe royalties in the coming years as the sale of this product is\\r\\nexpected to grow.\\r\\nIn the coming year the thrust will be on developing newer\\r\\napplications and entering into several international markets.\\r\\nThe company has developed many new fabricated products\\r\\napart from Tarpaulin. Due to its superior properties it is\\r\\ngetting increased acceptance in different applications. The\\r\\ncompany has successfully introduced this product in different\\r\\napplications by laminating the film with other substrate.\\r\\nThe technical collaborator of the company is working in\\r\\ntandem with the prospective customers of Cross Plastic Film\\r\\nto perfect the product in all respects. Once the product is\\r\\nperfected the company will be putting up plant to manufacture\\r\\nthis product at its Muvala plant.\\r\\n4.5 Construction Business\\r\\nThe company has developed Commercial Premises viz\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSupreme Chambers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with a view to monetize the land parcel\\r\\nwhere its first own manufacturing unit was functional. The\\r\\nbuilding was completed in 2010-2011 and all permissions are\\r\\nin place including Occupation Certificate.\\r\\nThe aforesaid commercial premises is marvelously designed\\r\\n& is having many eco-friendly features, aesthetically design\\r\\ngreen land scape area & the best of infrastructure & utilities.\\r\\nTHE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED n 47\\r\\nAt the beginning of the year total 63,868 sq.ft saleable area\\r\\nwas available for sale at the said premise. During the year\\r\\nunder review the company sold 12610 sq ft saleable area at\\r\\nan aggregate consideration of R 24.28 Crs. New construction in\\r\\ncommercial space is minimal. In view of limited availability of\\r\\ngood office premises and improved sentiments in Commercial\\r\\nspace market, Company is hopeful to monetize remaining\\r\\npremises of about 51,258 sq. ft. saleable area during current\\r\\nyear.\\r\\n4.6 New Initiatives\\r\\n4.6.1 Composite LPG Cylinder\\r\\nThrough the year gone by has not been to the expectation\\r\\nbut all the same now appears to be promising for the current\\r\\nfinancial year.\\r\\nThere were some minor technical issues on the cylinders\\r\\nsupplied by the Company to Korea and Bangladesh. All those\\r\\nissues have been resolved and clients have started discussions\\r\\nfor repeat orders.\\r\\nIt is encouraging to note that Bangladesh has been using\\r\\ncylinders for last one year and the Company is negotiating to\\r\\nsupply larger quantities in the current year.\\r\\nMarket demands 15.6 and 20 kg. cylinders. Company\\r\\ndeveloped the cylinders and got approval from TUV, PESO\\r\\nand KGS. In this, a trial lot has been shipped to Korea in 20\\r\\nkg. cylinder and the Company expects to have a good volume\\r\\nin these sizes since the country being a coastal region faces a\\r\\nproblem of rusting of steel cylinders.\\r\\nThe much awaited BIS Standards is complete and BIS 16646\\r\\nhas been published for Type IV composite cylinders. This was\\r\\nnecessary so that oil market companies can now take effective\\r\\nsteps to introduce composite cylinders in Indian market.\\r\\nThe feedback has been good from Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s customers for\\r\\nit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cylinders on whatever small quantities supplied by the\\r\\nCompany to Private Gas Companies in Goa, Belgaum and\\r\\nBengaluru. Company hopes to see better off-take from Indian\\r\\nGas Companies in coming year.\\r\\nCompany has acquired 10% business interest in HPC Research\\r\\ns.r.o. a start up company focusing on R & D in Composite\\r\\nCylinders in the Czech Republic which will strengthen its R &\\r\\nD footprint in the field of Pressure Vessels.\\r\\n5.

Laboratories UL listed still the Company needs product approval to install in Residential Commercial Buildings There is no single authority to approve the product and every State Government has their own rules and regulations to be followed in their States Certain states got Central Authority called Director Fire Services and the approval is acceptable to all the Fire Officers and Fire stations within their States But in certain States the Company has to seek approval from every Chief Fire Officer of a city which has status of Municipal Corporation Seeking approval is a time consuming process Thus the growth in this segment will be slow though it is internationally proven a better system than metal Fire Sprinkler System for Horizontal Application The BIS has not yet published the standard for CPVC Fire Sprinkler Fittings and also many amendments to IS 15105 which is a standard for design and installation of Fire Sprinkler System Although National Building Code 2016 has been

major Metropolitan and TierI cities As a result of these efforts the Company could install this system at Mumbai Pune and Goa locations for many upcoming Highrise Buildings These installations will work as a showcase to present it to future buyers consultants and installers The installers who did the mockup installations are truly satisfied They see tremendous benefit because of ease and speed of installation while using this product They have confirmed that the speed of installation is four times faster than the earlier metal installations and the skill requirement is less as no welding or threading operations are involved The Company has developed moulds for fast running fittings and the samples are already under testing with Underwriters Laboratories UL This will enhance Companys efficiency in delivering the products to the end users with speed The Company has started participating in various Fire and Safety Exhibitions in India as well as abroad as part of promotional activities This is helping in creating awareness to Supreme Flameguard Brand The Company is getting good response from Indian as well as Overseas buyers Apart from installation in India the Company has supplied its products to a hotel project in Sri Lanka and to a renowned distributor in Philippines The Company expects that most of the regulatory approvals will be over and indigenous development of products should be complete during the current Calendar year The business may catch momentum from the second half of the current financial year To support environment concern the Company is gearing up to meet with National Green Tribunal and court directive of phasing out Lead stabilizers from manufacturing of different types of u PVC Pipes The Company is planning a phased out schedule for

value terms and 8 on volume terms where as the overall Plastic Furniture Industry grew by only 4 on value terms The company faced initial hiccups in business with GST regime Sales in First Quarter were extremely sluggish due to introduction of GST and reduction in pipeline inventory with trade channels Further the GST rate which was kept at 28 in the beginning had an adverse effect on the business However reduction in GST rate from 28 to 18 gave boost to the business and the growth in second half of 201718 was a healthy 16 on value terms The company believes that with reduction in GST

      "b'Management Discussion and Analysis\\r\\n1. OVERVIEW\\r\\nThere were far reaching structural reforms implemented in the\\r\\nIndian economy in the last seventeen months starting from\\r\\nNovember 2016. In the process these measures have put the\\r\\neconomy on sound growth path. They augur well to put the\\r\\neconomy in high growth mode in future.\\r\\nThe most significant reform was introduction of Goods and\\r\\nService Tax w.e.f 1.7.2017. This single measure has integrated\\r\\nthe Country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economy. Overall, the incidence of indirect tax\\r\\nhas come down on most of the products by this measure of\\r\\nmerging several indirect taxes and cess charged on the products\\r\\nin different States prior to July 2017.\\r\\nThe streamlining of GST implementation and Tax rates took\\r\\nsome time. That has created upheaval in 1st half of last year.\\r\\nFor your Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business, the introduction of Realty\\r\\nEstate regulation Act (RERA) has also affected growth of piping\\r\\nbusiness in Housing Sector for several months.\\r\\nThe several initiatives taken by Government to boost rural\\r\\nincome and infrastructure are now fructifying to boost business\\r\\nin several segments which are catered by the Company . The\\r\\nCompany, therefore, envisaged a faster growth in business\\r\\nfrom April 2018 and beyond. On the basis of the promising\\r\\nfuture demand growth, the Company started committing larger\\r\\ninvestments during the year than planned at beginning of the\\r\\nyear.\\r\\nDue to hardening of Polymer Prices and lack of new capacity\\r\\nbuild up of the PVC resin all around the world, the PVC\\r\\nprices have moved to higher band. For the year 2018-19, it is\\r\\nexpected that the PVC price trend will remain on higher side.\\r\\nIn spite of increase in Crude prices, the prices of Polythene\\r\\nwill move to a lower level over the year as several new plants\\r\\nare starting in USA based on the low feed stock cost of Shale\\r\\ngas. Overall, the polymer prices will remain affordable.\\r\\nThe effect of Demonetization , GST and RERA looks to have\\r\\nsettled down to a large extent. The economy is moving to\\r\\nformal sector slowly, but surely from informal sector. This\\r\\naugurs well to boost the economic activity in the Country. The\\r\\ninitial forecast for Monsoon this year is also normal. Company,\\r\\ntherefore, expects business conditions to be favorable in the\\r\\nyear to boost the demand for it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s products.\\r\\nThe Company expects to put two new Greenfield plants\\r\\nin production this year \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one at Telangana and another at\\r\\nRajasthan. The Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s additional construction of buildings\\r\\nin existing plants and start up of production at those sites will\\r\\nalso go in production this year at Malanpur, Khopoli, Hosur\\r\\nand Kharagpur.\\r\\nThe Company intends to start two new plants at Andhra\\r\\nPradesh and Assam. Land acquisition process has started. They\\r\\nmay partially go into production next year.\\r\\nThe Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s units to make up automobile products at\\r\\nKhuskhera has been put in JV with a Japanese Company. The\\r\\nCompany may divest it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s small holding in that Unit within 2-3\\r\\nyears after start up of this J.V\\r\\n2. PRODUCT GROUPS\\r\\nThe product groups of the Company have been recast as\\r\\nfollows:\\r\\nGroup Products\\r\\nPlastics\\r\\nPiping\\r\\nSystem\\r\\nuPVC Pipes, Injection Moulded PVC fittings and\\r\\nhandmade fittings, Polypropylene Random Copolymer\\r\\npipe system, HDPE Pipe Systems, CPVC Pipes\\r\\nSystems, Inspection Chambers, manholes, Toilets Bath\\r\\nfittings, Roto moulded Tanks and Fittings and Solvents\\r\\nConsumer\\r\\nproducts\\r\\nFurniture\\r\\nIndustrial\\r\\nProducts\\r\\nIndustrial Components, Material handling System and\\r\\nPallets \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Roto moulded crates,pallets and garbage bins\\r\\nPackaging\\r\\nProducts\\r\\nFlexible packaging film products, Protective Packaging\\r\\nProducts, Cross Laminated Film products\\r\\nComposite\\r\\nProducts\\r\\nComposite LPG Cylinders,\\r\\nPRODUCT GROUP WISE SHARE IN TURNOVER FOR\\r\\nTHE LAST TWO YEARS (% OF VALUE)\\r\\nPlastics\\r\\nPiping\\r\\nSystem\\r\\n55.66%\\r\\nComposite\\r\\nCylinders\\r\\n0.03%\\r\\nPackaging\\r\\nProducts\\r\\n20.81%\\r\\nIndustrial\\r\\nProducts\\r\\n16.32%\\r\\nConsumer\\r\\nProducts\\r\\n7.18%\\r\\n2017-18\\r\\nIndustrial Products\\r\\n14.19%\\r\\nPackaging\\r\\nProducts\\r\\n22.32%\\r\\nConsumer\\r\\nProducts\\r\\nPlastics Piping 7.17%\\r\\nSystem 56.12%\\r\\n2016-17\\r\\nComposite\\r\\nCylinders 0.20%\\r\\nThe net turnover (including other income) of the Company\\r\\nfor the year under review was R 4983.80.Crores (including\\r\\nR 65.77 Crores by way of trading in other related products\\r\\nand R 24.28 crores from sale of Premises) as against R 4469.79\\r\\ncrores (including R 64.78 Crores by way of trading in other\\r\\nrelated products ) during the previous year.\\r\\nTHE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED n 41\\r\\nThe Company has sold 3,71,176 tons of Plastic products as\\r\\nagainst 3,40,906 tons of Plastic products in the corresponding\\r\\nperiod of previous year, reflecting a growth of 9% in product\\r\\nturnover by volume.\\r\\nThe Company exported goods worth US $ 16.93 . million as\\r\\nagainst US $ 13.50 million during the corresponding period\\r\\nof the previous year.\\r\\nProfit before interest, depreciation and exceptional items and\\r\\ntaxes during the period under review have been at R 804.31\\r\\ncrores as against R 769.61 crores during the previous year.\\r\\n3.

The distributors strength\\r\\nhas gone up to 3303.Nos by the end of March 2018 compared\\r\\nto 2973 nos by March 2017.\\r\\nWherever the Company could not find suitable distributors\\r\\nto buy and stock Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s products for re-distribution\\r\\nthroughout the retail chain of that area, the Company started\\r\\nselling products directly to big retailers in that area. Selectively,\\r\\nthe Company has strengthened it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supply system to service\\r\\nthose retailers in a cost efficient manner. The Company started\\r\\nthis only very selectively.\\r\\nYour Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Supreme brand is now registered with a\\r\\npunch line \\xe2\\x80\\x9c Supreme \\xe2\\x80\\x93 People who know plastics best.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n3.3 Growth Drivers\\r\\nYour Company is strengthening its brand in Two ways. One by\\r\\nincreasing expenditure on Advertisement through Electronic,\\r\\nPrint media and participating in several Exhibitions in India\\r\\nand abroad along with large meets of plumbers, Dealers,\\r\\nRetailers and Architects. The Company participated in several\\r\\nexhibitions in India and internationally last year. Secondly\\r\\nCompany is taking legal recourse to contain counterfeit\\r\\nproducts in Plastics pipe System, XF Products and Furniture.\\r\\nCompany assiduously works to address this menace.\\r\\n4. OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE\\r\\n4.1 Plastics Piping Systems\\r\\nThe Company continues its objective to grow in Plastic Pipe\\r\\nSystem business. The company is leader in this segment as it has\\r\\nthe largest portfolio of products, which is being continuously\\r\\nincreased, to offer more systems as required in the economy.\\r\\nThe introduction of GST regime in the country augured well\\r\\nfor growth of this business. There is likelihood of shift in\\r\\nbusiness from unorganized players to organized players over\\r\\nthe period. This is expected to lead to growth in the business\\r\\nof your Company in forthcoming years.\\r\\nThe Company during the year under review registered an over\\r\\nall revenue growth of 10% in Plastic Piping System made from\\r\\ndifferent plastic materials. Overall the company sold 2,56,330\\r\\nTons of Pipe System compared to 2,35,256 Tons in same period\\r\\nof last year.\\r\\nThe growth in the business was not upto Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nexpectation. GST introduction has put damper in Agri market\\r\\nrequirement in April/June. Real Estate Regulation Act (RERA)\\r\\nto regulate the Housing Sector has slowed down the demand\\r\\nfrom this sector for quite a period.\\r\\nThe Government at the Centre and States has put the priority\\r\\nfocus on Swatch Bharat Abhiyan, Sanitation and affordable\\r\\nhouses to all and development of 100 smart cities on all\\r\\nIndia basis. Real Estate Regulation Act (RERA) has created a\\r\\nmajor transformation the way housing construction for sale\\r\\nwas in vogue in the Country. It affected the business growth\\r\\nin Housing in the year under review. The growth tempo has\\r\\nnow started and the Company expects good demand coming\\r\\nfrom this segment in this year.\\r\\nThe Company incurred Capex of R 144 crore in this year in it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nvarious plants to build more capacities and increase product\\r\\nrange. Majority of them has been put to use .\\r\\nThe Company with objective of making its footprint for\\r\\nmanufacturing at South Zone, for Plastic Piping Division,\\r\\nhas got 50 acres of land allotted at Jadcherla-District\\r\\nMahaboobnagar at Telangana. The civil construction work\\r\\nhas started and production of Water & Septic Tanks is likely to\\r\\nstart in October/December \\xe2\\x80\\x992018. The Company will launch\\r\\nother Piping System products at this location in next one/ two\\r\\nyear. The Company has entered into a MOU with the State\\r\\nGovernment of Andhra Government to put up a project at\\r\\nNellore district. Efforts are being made to acquire the required\\r\\nland of approx. 40 acres to start the manufacturing there. The\\r\\nCompany aims to start production at the same site in second\\r\\nhalf of 2019-2020.\\r\\nThe plant at Kharagpur is fully operational. The capacity\\r\\nincrease for PVC,HDPE & CPVC Pipes is now in place and\\r\\nbecome operational. The Company is also exploring further\\r\\nincreasing the capacity of HDPE Pipe at Kharagpur plant to\\r\\ncater to increased demand.\\r\\nTo meet the increasing demand of HDPE Pipes in North India,\\r\\nthe Company has taken in hand to put up the capacity in\\r\\nMalanpur Unit No.3. The same will go in production in July/\\r\\nSeptember 2018 quarter.\\r\\nAnother Roto Moulding plant is now operational at Kharagpur.\\r\\nThe enhanced capacity at Gadegaon facility for Roto Moulded\\r\\nProducts is made operational.

At Kharagpur the\\r\\nBIS certification for Pipes up to diameter of 500 mm is received\\r\\nand for balance sizes of 600 mm and 800 mm diameter is\\r\\nlikely to be received shortly.\\r\\n42 n THE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED\\r\\nThe company introduced 195 nos. of variety of Injection\\r\\nMoulded Pipe fittings during 2017-18. They all have been well\\r\\nreceived in the market. The sale of moulded fittings increased\\r\\nby 6% in volume terms during the year under review. The\\r\\nCompany has plan of introducing further new items during\\r\\nthe year as per system requirement.\\r\\nThe Company manufactures the cPVC Pipes at three of\\r\\nits manufacturing location and cPVC Fittings at two of its\\r\\nmanufacturing locations. The Company has planned further\\r\\nexpansion of CPVC System manufacturing at it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s existing plants.\\r\\nThe total product portfolio in Pipe System has reached 7730\\r\\nnos., thus adding 500 products to the range of various Plastic\\r\\nPiping System.\\r\\nThe AQUAKRAFT Bath Fittings introduced by the company\\r\\nis well established now including newly launched Chrome\\r\\nPlated range. There were 11 new items introduced during the\\r\\nyear.

The Company plans to further\\r\\ncomplement the range during 2018-19 by introducing large\\r\\nvarieties of products in Bath fittings.\\r\\nThe Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business to Export market during the year saw\\r\\na growth of 48% in US $ terms. The company is continuously\\r\\ntrying to boost its export business of Piping Systems.\\r\\nThe Division\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Value Added Products sale was 31.76%.

The company has\\r\\nalso started directly servicing retailers in selected markets.\\r\\nThe Company has now multiple Knowledge Centres across\\r\\nthe country to facilitate the services locally. At Gadegaon for\\r\\nthe customers of Western India, at Kochi for the customers of\\r\\nSouthern India, at Malanpur for customers of Northern India\\r\\nand at Kharagpur for customers of Eastern India.\\r\\nAlthough Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s CPVC Fire Sprinkler System is approved\\r\\nby Bureau of Indian Standard (BIS) and is also Underwriters\\r\\nLaboratories (UL) listed, still the Company needs product\\r\\napproval to install in Residential /Commercial Buildings.\\r\\nThere is no single authority to approve the product and every\\r\\nState Government has their own rules and regulations to be\\r\\nfollowed in their States. Certain states got Central Authority\\r\\ncalled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDirector Fire Services\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the approval is acceptable\\r\\nto all the Fire Officers and Fire stations within their States.\\r\\nBut in certain States the Company has to seek approval from\\r\\nevery Chief Fire Officer of a city which has status of Municipal\\r\\nCorporation. Seeking approval is a time consuming process.\\r\\nThus the growth in this segment will be slow though it is\\r\\ninternationally proven a better system than metal Fire Sprinkler\\r\\nSystem for Horizontal Application.\\r\\nThe BIS has not yet published the standard for CPVC Fire\\r\\nSprinkler Fittings and also many amendments to IS- 15105,\\r\\nwhich is a standard for design and installation of Fire Sprinkler\\r\\nSystem. Although National Building Code 2016 has been\\r\\npublished the implementation part has still not gathered pace.\\r\\nAs a result the awareness about mandatory installation of CPVC\\r\\nFire Sprinkler System in High-rise Residential Apartments as\\r\\nwell as Commercial buildings is not catching the momentum.\\r\\nThe Company is putting lot of efforts in creating awareness\\r\\nabout it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s products by meeting various Developers, Consultants\\r\\nand Installers in all the major Metropolitan and Tier-I cities. As\\r\\na result of these efforts the Company could install this system\\r\\nat Mumbai, Pune and Goa locations for many upcoming Highrise\\r\\nBuildings. These installations will work as a showcase to\\r\\npresent it to future buyers, consultants and installers.\\r\\nThe installers who did the mock-up installations are truly\\r\\nsatisfied. They see tremendous benefit because of ease and\\r\\nspeed of installation while using this product. They have\\r\\nconfirmed that the speed of installation is four times faster\\r\\nthan the earlier metal installations and the skill requirement\\r\\nis less as no welding or threading operations are involved.\\r\\nThe Company has developed moulds for fast running fittings\\r\\nand the samples are already under testing with Underwriters\\r\\nLaboratories (UL). This will enhance Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s efficiency in\\r\\ndelivering the products to the end users with speed.\\r\\nThe Company has started participating in various \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFire and\\r\\nSafety\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Exhibitions in India as well as abroad as part of\\r\\npromotional activities. This is helping in creating awareness to\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Supreme Flameguard\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Brand . The Company is getting good\\r\\nresponse from Indian as well as Overseas buyers.\\r\\nApart from installation in India the Company has supplied it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nproducts to a hotel project in Sri Lanka and to a renowned\\r\\ndistributor in Philippines.\\r\\nThe Company expects that most of the regulatory approvals\\r\\nwill be over and indigenous development of products should\\r\\nbe complete during the current Calendar year. The business\\r\\nmay catch momentum from the second half of the current\\r\\nfinancial year.\\r\\nTo support environment concern the Company is gearing up\\r\\nto meet with National Green Tribunal and court directive of\\r\\nphasing out Lead stabilizers from manufacturing of different\\r\\ntypes of u PVC Pipes. The Company is planning a phased\\r\\nout schedule for different variety of PVC Pipes having Lead\\r\\nstabilizers to produce with Lead free stabilizers.\\r\\n4.2 Consumer Products\\r\\n4.2.1 FURNITURE\\r\\nThe business during the year had a good growth. The company\\r\\ngrew by 11 % on value terms and 8 % on volume terms where\\r\\nas the overall Plastic Furniture Industry grew by only 4 % on\\r\\nvalue terms. The company faced initial hiccups in business with\\r\\nGST regime. Sales in First Quarter were extremely sluggish due\\r\\nto introduction of GST and reduction in pipeline inventory\\r\\nwith trade channels. Further, the GST rate which was kept at\\r\\n28 % in the beginning had an adverse effect on the business.\\r\\nHowever, reduction in GST rate from 28 % to 18 % gave boost\\r\\nto the business and the growth in second half of 2017-18 was\\r\\na healthy 16% on value terms. The company believes that with\\r\\nreduction in GST rate & effective compliance, the share of\\r\\norganized players should increase in overall plastic furniture\\r\\nbusiness over the period.\\r\\nThe company currently manufactures Injection Moulded\\r\\nFurniture & Blow Moulded Furniture. It has 5 units\\r\\nmanufacturing Injection Moulded Furniture across the country\\r\\nat Puducherry (UT), Durgapur (West Bengal), Derabassi\\r\\nTHE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED n 43\\r\\n(Punjab), Gadegaon (Maharashtra) & Guwahati (Assam) to\\r\\ncater effectively different regions of the country. The company\\r\\nhas also started manufacturing Blow Moulded Tables at its\\r\\nKharagpur (West Bengal) plant. The company is putting up a\\r\\nGreen Field Plant at Jadcherla ( Telangana ) for manufacture\\r\\nof Injection Moulded Furniture for increasing its market share\\r\\nin Southern India. The company believes the new plant will\\r\\nalso be a good feeder unit for all other parts of the country\\r\\ndue to its central location and good connectivity. The plant\\r\\nis likely to go in production by third quarter of this year and\\r\\ncontribute to growth in last two quarters.\\r\\nThe growth in company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business is primarily attributed to\\r\\nits continuing focus on increasing its distribution set up and\\r\\ndelivering high quality product & service to its customers. The\\r\\ncompany\\xe2\\x80\\x99s furniture is currently available to its customers\\r\\nthrough nationwide network of around 11,000 retailers .The\\r\\ncompany has established itself as a premium brand amongst\\r\\nits trade channel and customers due to its continuous focus\\r\\non Quality, innovation and wide range of products. During the\\r\\nyear, the company increased its strength of channel partners\\r\\nfrom 814 Nos. to 900 Nos. and continues to increase its\\r\\npresence in the unrepresented areas.\\r\\nThe company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new product line of Blow Moulded Tables\\r\\nhas been well received by customers and is considered as top\\r\\nclass in Quality. At present, the company is offering Tables in\\r\\n8 Sizes and will be adding 4 more sizes by end of September\\r\\n2018. The company also plans to develop more products to\\r\\ncater different market segments.\\r\\nThe product line requires intensive marketing combined\\r\\nwith education about its benefits vis a vis other conventional\\r\\nwooden tables and the company hopes to grow in 2018-19\\r\\nin this segment primarily from domestic market. The export\\r\\npotential for this product line is big. The Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s quality\\r\\nof product is far superior comparable to competitive products\\r\\nin the world market. Once the range becomes large and get\\r\\nwell established in domestic market , then the Company aims\\r\\nto launch it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s product in international markets.\\r\\nThe company introduced 7 new furniture models during\\r\\nthe year. The Fusion Series of Cupboards found very high\\r\\nacceptance amongst the customers due to its unique aesthetic\\r\\ndeign. The company also launched its two seater rattan finish\\r\\nLove Seat Sofa which made an ideal combination with its fast\\r\\nselling model Cambridge Chair and Vegas Center Table . The\\r\\ncomplete set has been well appreciated in domestic as well as\\r\\nInternational Market. All the new models introduced during\\r\\nthe year were well appreciated and the company hopes to get\\r\\ngood growth from its new introductions.\\r\\nThe company continues to focus on developing its export\\r\\nmarket and has found good acceptance by various customers.\\r\\nThe company has now started exports to Twelve countries and\\r\\nhopes to grow substantially from this segment. The Company\\r\\nparticipates in several exhibitions to promote it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s quality\\r\\nproducts.\\r\\n4.3 Industrial Products\\r\\n4.3.1 Industrial Components\\r\\nThe year started against the backdrop of improved business\\r\\nsentiments resulting from gradual economic recovery because\\r\\nof various reforms initiated by the government. Demand revival\\r\\ntook momentum in various segments including Automotive\\r\\nand Consumer Durable sector in which the Division has major\\r\\nbusiness portfolio. At the beginning of the year, the Division\\r\\nhad projected growth of 20% and 12% in Value and Volume\\r\\nterms in both the sectors put together. The initial negative effect\\r\\nof major economic Structural Reforms like Demonetization\\r\\nand GST having faded, demand progressively picked up\\r\\nin all segments of Automobile sector like 2 Wheeler/3\\r\\nWheeler, Cars/SUVs and Commercial Vehicles and in White\\r\\nGoods like washing Machines, Refrigerators and other home\\r\\nappliances. The good monsoon also helped demand boost in\\r\\nAutomotive and Appliances. Division grew by 31% and 18%\\r\\nrespectively in Volume and Value terms over previous year.\\r\\nWith microeconomic parameters encouraging, GST getting\\r\\nstabilized and improved confidence in economy, the Company\\r\\nexpects further expansion in demand which should pave the\\r\\nway for further growth during the current year.\\r\\nNoida Plant revenue had improved significantly during the\\r\\nyear under review and grew by 46% . Noida plant improved\\r\\nits customer base to have sizable spread in non-Appliances to\\r\\ncounter seasonal demand volatility. Hence plant could achieve\\r\\nfairly uniform production with low level of volatility. Demand\\r\\nfor AC segment improved considerably showing healthy\\r\\ngrowth. Company expects AC segment to grow significantly\\r\\nand concentrating on new customer development in this\\r\\nproduct line. In order to meet improved demand of one of\\r\\nCompany\\xe2\\x80\\x99s major AC customer and reduce logistics cost for\\r\\nthe customer, company decided to put up a new plant at\\r\\nGhiloth, Rajasthan and started the project work in full swing.\\r\\nThe project is already at last leg of completion and expected\\r\\nto go in production in April-June, quarter. With the continued\\r\\nefforts in developing new Business Mix, company expects\\r\\nsteady growth at Noida plant in future. Lot of steps were taken\\r\\nto carry out layout changes and many other improvements to\\r\\nmake the plant future ready as the plant is three decade old\\r\\nand was requiring revamp. During the year, the Plant cleared\\r\\nInitial Assessment and Final Audit for TPM Excellence by JIPM\\r\\n(Japan Institute of Plant Maintenance). The Plant received the\\r\\nprestigious Award of TPM Excellence during the year. The\\r\\nmovement will be accelerated further to next level during the\\r\\nyears to come.\\r\\nAuto Business in the western India which started showing\\r\\nrecovery during FY 16-17 accelerated further during FY17-18\\r\\nimproving revenue of Talegaon Plant resulting in robust growth\\r\\nof 58% in sales revenue. The business of some automotive\\r\\nmodels, which were acquired during previous years from the\\r\\nmajor customer Tata Motors, started showing demand pick\\r\\nup. Supply of Cockpit Assembly which started for the LCV/\\r\\nMCV Model \\xe2\\x80\\x98Ultra\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of Tata Motors; during previous year,\\r\\nramped up considerably and is expected to improve further\\r\\nduring coming years. The New 2 Wheeler model SR 150\\r\\nand the existing Vespa together registered better demand\\r\\nimproving revenue of Talegaon plant. Plant Capacity Utilization\\r\\nimproved significantly. Company is aggressively focusing to\\r\\nimprove business at Talegaon by strengthening its Business\\r\\nDevelopment cell.\\r\\nKhushkhera Plant sales revived and grew by 8%. Supplies\\r\\nhave been successfully established for one of the prestigious\\r\\n44 n THE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED\\r\\nSUV model of Honda Car, WR-V. Development is on for\\r\\nseveral other models for Maruti Suzuki and Honda. Company\\r\\nhas been continuously exploring good business opportunities\\r\\nfrom Maruti, Honda and other tier one customers in many of\\r\\ntheir new models. However, it is felt that Company needs to\\r\\nstrengthen its capabilities and reorganize not only a component\\r\\nsupplier but also to become complete source of supply right\\r\\nfrom designing, development to supply of products which can\\r\\nbe done effectively by the Company having such technical\\r\\nstrength and capabilities.\\r\\nKeeping the same in mind,Company has entered into a\\r\\njoint venture with Kumi Kasei Co., Ltd (Kumi), a company\\r\\nincorporated in Japan, to set up a new entity by the name of\\r\\nKumi Supreme India Private Limited (JVC). Kumi is a major\\r\\nsupplier to Honda for many interior parts for automotive\\r\\napplication all over the world. They have been Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nTechnology Partner for the last six years for Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nautomotive supplies to Honda in India. The JVC would take\\r\\nover Khushkhera plant operations as a going concern on a\\r\\nslump sale basis. Transaction is likely to be completed by\\r\\n30th June, 2018. This Joint Venture may further improve\\r\\ntechnological competence of the Auto Comp Business and\\r\\nwill help in strengthening Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s relationship with all it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ncustomers.\\r\\nBusiness opportunities are encouraging for Chennai Plant.\\r\\nPlant registered growth of only 4% as company couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t grab\\r\\nthe business opportunities due to capacity constraints in the\\r\\nplant. Currently plant is running at its optimum capacity.\\r\\nCompany is now in the process of acquiring land adjacent to\\r\\nits existing facility, which will be used for expanding the plant.\\r\\nCompany plans to expand and increase the plant capacity to\\r\\nfacilitate acquiring future opportunities. Bosch has set up its\\r\\nhuge manufacturing facility in India, at Chennai and would be\\r\\nlaunching various other Home Appliance products during next\\r\\nfew years. Company expects good growth with this customer\\r\\nin years to come.

This business has shown healthy growth\\r\\nof 30%.\\r\\nThe Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s customers are appreciative of the quality of\\r\\nthe products.\\r\\nCompany\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Crate business has been decreasing in Dairy\\r\\nand fruits and vegetables segment. This is mainly due to\\r\\nabundant use of reprocessed material by many players in these\\r\\napplications. Company is able to participate only where good\\r\\nquality products are required.\\r\\nTHE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED n 45\\r\\nInjection Moulded Pallet business has achieved volume growth\\r\\nof 12%.\\r\\nCompany has developed some new products which should\\r\\nget better response from the customers.\\r\\nMHD products made by Roto Moulding has also shown good\\r\\ngrowth of 20% over last year.

Therefore there\\r\\nwas no growth possible in the year under review.\\r\\nOverall sale was 7454 tons in the year under review vis a vis\\r\\n7596 tons in the previous year. The sales in value term dropped\\r\\nfrom R 129.40 Crores to R 125.31 Crores . This was due to fall\\r\\nin raw material prices as well as drop in selling price.\\r\\nDuring the year under review, exports stood at 1659 tons as\\r\\nagainst 1028 tons in corresponding period of previous year.\\r\\nThe company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thrust on export resulted in robust growth of\\r\\n61 % in volume. This trend will continue with addition of new\\r\\ncustomers in several geographies.\\r\\nThe customers of the Company have shown confidence in the\\r\\nquality of Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s films and service.\\r\\nThe division\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sales have been consistent and customer base\\r\\ncould be maintained by virtue of quality of products & high\\r\\nservice standards. As the capacity of the division remains fully\\r\\nutilised, the division has committed an investment of R 41\\r\\ncrores to expand its capacity at existing Khopoli unit.. The\\r\\nsame may go in production in Jan/March 2019 quarter. This\\r\\nwill increase the capacity by around 5000 Tons per annum.\\r\\n4.4.2 Protective packaging division (PPD)\\r\\nProtective packaging division (PPD) recorded 16% growth in\\r\\nvalue & 17.5% in volume during the year under review. The\\r\\ntotal sale was 23335 tons against 19853 tons last year\\r\\nOverall packaging business was good during the year under\\r\\nreview. The de-growth of the business of insulation grade\\r\\ncross-linked polyethylene foam has continued, as more\\r\\ncompetitors entered the business during the year. Most of the\\r\\nmanufacturers are supplying substandard products against\\r\\ntheir own declared specifications. The division has taken up\\r\\na challenge to build quality awareness among the customers\\r\\nand approving authorities by several modes of communication.\\r\\nThis is however a long drawn process. NBR sheet plant has\\r\\ncommenced production in the first week of April after a delay\\r\\nof over 4 months due to delayed supply of equipments. This\\r\\nwill enhance Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s product offering for insulation range\\r\\nof products. However competition may remain fierce in the\\r\\ncoming year.\\r\\nMany of the civil projects are getting restarted and it is expected\\r\\nthat the demand will improve for the DURA range of products\\r\\nin the current year.\\r\\nThe market response for the new ranges of products like\\r\\nchildren education toys, sports, health sector, & interiors which\\r\\nwere launched last year has been encouraging.

The\\r\\ndivision is also developing sport specific certified interlock\\r\\nmats.\\r\\nThe division is now an approved vendor of Decathlon, a\\r\\nleading global sports goods retailer, for yoga mats. Several\\r\\nother products are in the pipeline for approval.\\r\\nThe acoustic range of products haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t picked up as well as\\r\\nexpected, due to the limited availability of NBR bonded block\\r\\nfoam and some technical issues related to the other range of\\r\\nproducts. The division is expecting a good growth of business\\r\\nof this vertical during the year due to enhanced availability of\\r\\nthe NBR bonded block foam.\\r\\nHosur unit I & 2 will be merged alongwith the expansion at\\r\\nunit 2 & is expected to go in full production by August 2018.\\r\\nUnit 1 operation will then be shut down. The company would\\r\\ndivest the land & building of this unit thereafter.\\r\\nThe production capacity of Kharagpur unit will be enhanced\\r\\nby 2600 MTPA during the current year by constructing a new\\r\\nbuilding and addition of Cross Linked Foam products.\\r\\nThe division is also doing the feasibility study for enhancing\\r\\nproduction capacity at Malanpur.\\r\\nThe division has started work at the Jadcherla complex which\\r\\nis being set up.

Present production capacity of 28,600 tons will increase\\r\\nto 38,500 TPA without considering Jadcherla and Malanpur\\r\\nexpansion.\\r\\nPackaging\\r\\nPackaging vertical grew by 20.08% in value and 21% in volume\\r\\nas against last year. Enhanced productivity & improved quality\\r\\nstandards have been achieved by re-engineering of existing\\r\\nequipment/equipments resulting in growth of business. The\\r\\nR & D team is also working on developments of new variants\\r\\nof polyethylene foam range of products which are application\\r\\nspecific.\\r\\n46 n THE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED\\r\\nThe new bubble plant which was installed last year at Hosur\\r\\nunit has been modified for the production of new range of\\r\\ncomposite products which was not possible earlier in any of\\r\\nour existing equipments. The Company expects good growth\\r\\nin the premium range of products during the year. Business\\r\\nof two stage block foam which was sluggish over the past few\\r\\nyears is now picking up and it is expected that the capacity\\r\\nwill be well utilized in the current year.\\r\\nBusiness of EVA foam moulded products has not yet started.\\r\\nSeveral products for the sports & health sector have been\\r\\nidentified & will be launched by the end of 1st quarter. Further\\r\\nproducts would be added in the year.\\r\\nCivil\\r\\nBusiness grew by 9.18% value and 1.55% by volume in the\\r\\ncurrent year. The division has been awarded BIS certification\\r\\nfor its DURA HD 100 for expansion joint application. Demand\\r\\nfor DURA range of products is now increasing for the business\\r\\nin project based business.

As informed earlier, several new competitors\\r\\nentered the business simultaneously & dropped prices\\r\\ninappropriately while compromising on desired quality\\r\\nstandards. This had severely impacted Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business &\\r\\nprofitability. However, constant efforts to sell products based\\r\\non required quality standards has started to yield results. NBR\\r\\nsheet plant will expand existing portfolio of products in this\\r\\nvertical.\\r\\nTechnology\\r\\nThe Technical team of the division has been working on\\r\\ninnovative ideas to develop new products, new applications, &\\r\\nupgrading of existing processing facilities and other segments.\\r\\nThe Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s innovative & light weight products have been\\r\\nbeneficial to industry & the society at large\\r\\nThe Indian Green Building Council ( IGBC ) has certified all of\\r\\nCompany\\xe2\\x80\\x99s insulation range of products. The division has also\\r\\nreceived 8th Plasticon Award in the category of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInnovation in\\r\\nPolymer Waste Management and Recycling Technology\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on\\r\\nthe bonded block foam.\\r\\n4.4.3 Cross Laminated Film\\r\\nThe Business of Cross Laminated film and products had a\\r\\nde-growth during the year which witnessed slow down in\\r\\neconomy in the first half due to roll out of Goods & Service\\r\\nTax (GST). Several new players have also entered this business\\r\\nin the country claiming to make similar products like our\\r\\nCompany. Combination of these two factors have affected the\\r\\nvolume & margins in this segment of business.\\r\\nPrior to launch of GST on 1st July, 2017 there was lot of\\r\\nconfusion, particularly amongst the traders, regarding eligibility\\r\\nof credit of duties paid on purchase of goods which remained\\r\\nin stock on the date of GST implementation. Most of the\\r\\ncompany\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dealers curtailed purchases to maintain stocks at\\r\\na very low level. This adversely impacted sale of company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nproducts during the first quarter of the year which are supposed\\r\\nto be the peak months for the sale of tarpaulins. In the GST\\r\\nregime, the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s main product tarpaulin was placed\\r\\ninitially in the highest rate bracket i.e. 28%. This made the\\r\\nproduct costly to the end users. After lot of representations\\r\\nat various forums the GST rate on tarpaulin was reduced\\r\\nfrom 28% to 18% but in the meantime company lost sizeable\\r\\nbusiness. Though the sales picked up from September\\r\\nonwards, the loss of sales during the first five months could\\r\\nnot be recouped.\\r\\nThere was small growth in the 35GSM Silpoly Liner business.\\r\\nThe company is promoting this product in newer applications\\r\\nwith positive response.\\r\\nAs per the prediction of India Meteorological Department\\r\\nthe 2018 monsoon is expected to be normal brightening\\r\\nthe chances of recovery in the farm sector & growth in rural\\r\\neconomy. This may boost the demand for Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s products,\\r\\nmost of which find application in agriculture sector.\\r\\nThe company is hopeful of getting increased foothold in the\\r\\nUSA market in the coming years. The company is working on\\r\\ndeveloping specialized new applications to increase the size\\r\\nof market. The company aims to bringing in new customers\\r\\nin its fold in the existing markets & reaching out new markets\\r\\nwhere at present it does not have any presence by show casing\\r\\nits products in various international exhibitions.\\r\\nWith enhanced capacity at its disposal the company has made\\r\\nCross Line (XL) Bonded Film available in almost all thicknesses.\\r\\nThis product has superior properties than the normal XF Film\\r\\n& enjoys patent protection. The company has now acquired\\r\\nall the rights in the patents of Cross Line Bonded Film from\\r\\nthe technical collaborator. This will bring in lot of savings in\\r\\nthe royalties in the coming years as the sale of this product is\\r\\nexpected to grow.\\r\\nIn the coming year the thrust will be on developing newer\\r\\napplications and entering into several international markets.\\r\\nThe company has developed many new fabricated products\\r\\napart from Tarpaulin. Due to its superior properties it is\\r\\ngetting increased acceptance in different applications. The\\r\\ncompany has successfully introduced this product in different\\r\\napplications by laminating the film with other substrate.\\r\\nThe technical collaborator of the company is working in\\r\\ntandem with the prospective customers of Cross Plastic Film\\r\\nto perfect the product in all respects. Once the product is\\r\\nperfected the company will be putting up plant to manufacture\\r\\nthis product at its Muvala plant.\\r\\n4.5 Construction Business\\r\\nThe company has developed Commercial Premises viz\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSupreme Chambers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with a view to monetize the land parcel\\r\\nwhere its first own manufacturing unit was functional. The\\r\\nbuilding was completed in 2010-2011 and all permissions are\\r\\nin place including Occupation Certificate.\\r\\nThe aforesaid commercial premises is marvelously designed\\r\\n& is having many eco-friendly features, aesthetically design\\r\\ngreen land scape area & the best of infrastructure & utilities.\\r\\nTHE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED n 47\\r\\nAt the beginning of the year total 63,868 sq.ft saleable area\\r\\nwas available for sale at the said premise. During the year\\r\\nunder review the company sold 12610 sq ft saleable area at\\r\\nan aggregate consideration of R 24.28 Crs. New construction in\\r\\ncommercial space is minimal. In view of limited availability of\\r\\ngood office premises and improved sentiments in Commercial\\r\\nspace market, Company is hopeful to monetize remaining\\r\\npremises of about 51,258 sq. ft. saleable area during current\\r\\nyear.\\r\\n4.6 New Initiatives\\r\\n4.6.1 Composite LPG Cylinder\\r\\nThrough the year gone by has not been to the expectation\\r\\nbut all the same now appears to be promising for the current\\r\\nfinancial year.\\r\\nThere were some minor technical issues on the cylinders\\r\\nsupplied by the Company to Korea and Bangladesh. All those\\r\\nissues have been resolved and clients have started discussions\\r\\nfor repeat orders.\\r\\nIt is encouraging to note that Bangladesh has been using\\r\\ncylinders for last one year and the Company is negotiating to\\r\\nsupply larger quantities in the current year.\\r\\nMarket demands 15.6 and 20 kg. cylinders. Company\\r\\ndeveloped the cylinders and got approval from TUV, PESO\\r\\nand KGS. In this, a trial lot has been shipped to Korea in 20\\r\\nkg. cylinder and the Company expects to have a good volume\\r\\nin these sizes since the country being a coastal region faces a\\r\\nproblem of rusting of steel cylinders.\\r\\nThe much awaited BIS Standards is complete and BIS 16646\\r\\nhas been published for Type IV composite cylinders. This was\\r\\nnecessary so that oil market companies can now take effective\\r\\nsteps to introduce composite cylinders in Indian market.\\r\\nThe feedback has been good from Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s customers for\\r\\nit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cylinders on whatever small quantities supplied by the\\r\\nCompany to Private Gas Companies in Goa, Belgaum and\\r\\nBengaluru. Company hopes to see better off-take from Indian\\r\\nGas Companies in coming year.\\r\\nCompany has acquired 10% business interest in HPC Research\\r\\ns.r.o. a start up company focusing on R & D in Composite\\r\\nCylinders in the Czech Republic which will strengthen its R &\\r\\nD footprint in the field of Pressure Vessels.\\r\\n5.

COMPANY\\xe2\\x80\\x99S STRENGTH AND GROWTH DRIVERS\\r\\n3.1 M anufacturing Sites\\r\\nThe Company is operating from 25 manufacturing sites\\r\\noperating in 11States and Union Territories. The Company\\r\\nintends to start working on two new sites to put up plant in the\\r\\ncurrent year. It is expected that the Company will be finalizing\\r\\nthe location in Andhra Pradesh and Assam during this year and\\r\\nstart activities to put up the plants.\\r\\n3.2 Distribution network\\r\\nYour Company is committed to increase its reach throughout\\r\\nthe country. To attain this objective, the Company has added\\r\\nfurther distributors in the past year. The distributors strength\\r\\nhas gone up to 3303.Nos by the end of March 2018 compared\\r\\nto 2973 nos by March 2017.\\r\\nWherever the Company could not find suitable distributors\\r\\nto buy and stock Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s products for re-distribution\\r\\nthroughout the retail chain of that area, the Company started\\r\\nselling products directly to big retailers in that area.

One by\\r\\nincreasing expenditure on Advertisement through Electronic,\\r\\nPrint media and participating in several Exhibitions in India\\r\\nand abroad along with large meets of plumbers, Dealers,\\r\\nRetailers and\n",
      "Print ---> Architects. The Company participated in several\\r\\nexhibitions in India and internationally last year. Secondly\\r\\nCompany is taking legal recourse to contain counterfeit\\r\\nproducts in Plastics pipe System, XF Products and Furniture.\\r\\nCompany assiduously works to address this menace.\\r\\n4. OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE\\r\\n4.1 Plastics Piping Systems\\r\\nThe Company continues its objective to grow in Plastic Pipe\\r\\nSystem business. The company is leader in this segment as it has\\r\\nthe largest portfolio of products, which is being continuously\\r\\nincreased, to offer more systems as required in the economy.\\r\\nThe introduction of GST regime in the country augured well\\r\\nfor growth of this business. There is likelihood of shift in\\r\\nbusiness from unorganized players to organized players over\\r\\nthe period. This is expected to lead to growth in the business\\r\\nof your Company in forthcoming years.\\r\\nThe Company during the year under review registered an over\\r\\nall revenue growth of 10% in Plastic Piping System made from\\r\\ndifferent plastic materials. Overall the company sold 2,56,330\\r\\nTons of Pipe System compared to 2,35,256 Tons in same period\\r\\nof last year.\\r\\nThe growth in the business was not upto Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nexpectation. GST introduction has put damper in Agri market\\r\\nrequirement in April/June. Real Estate Regulation Act (RERA)\\r\\nto regulate the Housing Sector has slowed down the demand\\r\\nfrom this sector for quite a period.\\r\\nThe Government at the Centre and States has put the priority\\r\\nfocus on Swatch Bharat Abhiyan, Sanitation and affordable\\r\\nhouses to all and development of 100 smart cities on all\\r\\nIndia basis. Real Estate Regulation Act (RERA) has created a\\r\\nmajor transformation the way housing construction for sale\\r\\nwas in vogue in the Country. It affected the business growth\\r\\nin Housing in the year under review. The growth tempo has\\r\\nnow started and the Company expects good demand coming\\r\\nfrom this segment in this year.\\r\\nThe Company incurred Capex of R 144 crore in this year in it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nvarious plants to build more capacities and increase product\\r\\nrange. Majority of them has been put to use .\\r\\nThe Company with objective of making its footprint for\\r\\nmanufacturing at South Zone, for Plastic Piping Division,\\r\\nhas got 50 acres of land allotted at Jadcherla-District\\r\\nMahaboobnagar at Telangana. The civil construction work\\r\\nhas started and production of Water & Septic Tanks is likely to\\r\\nstart in October/December \\xe2\\x80\\x992018. The Company will launch\\r\\nother Piping System products at this location in next one/ two\\r\\nyear. The Company has entered into a MOU with the State\\r\\nGovernment of Andhra Government to put up a project at\\r\\nNellore district. Efforts are being made to acquire the required\\r\\nland of approx. 40 acres to start the manufacturing there. The\\r\\nCompany aims to start production at the same site in second\\r\\nhalf of 2019-2020.\\r\\nThe plant at Kharagpur is fully operational. The capacity\\r\\nincrease for PVC,HDPE & CPVC Pipes is now in place and\\r\\nbecome operational. The Company is also exploring further\\r\\nincreasing the capacity of HDPE Pipe at Kharagpur plant to\\r\\ncater to increased demand.\\r\\nTo meet the increasing demand of HDPE Pipes in North India,\\r\\nthe Company has taken in hand to put up the capacity in\\r\\nMalanpur Unit No.3. The same will go in production in July/\\r\\nSeptember 2018 quarter.\\r\\nAnother Roto Moulding plant is now operation\n",
      "Print --->al at Kharagpur.\\r\\nThe enhanced capacity at Gadegaon facility for Roto Moulded\\r\\nProducts is made operational. The capacity of Roto Moulded\\r\\nProducts is being planned to increase at Malanpur and Kanpur\\r\\nplant.\\r\\nThe production of Double Wall Corrugated HDPE Pipes\\r\\nhas started from Gadegaon plant with BIS Certification. The\\r\\ncompany has also started commercial production of Double\\r\\nWall Corrugated HDPE Pipes at Kharagpur. At Kharagpur the\\r\\nBIS certification for Pipes up to diameter of 500 mm is received\\r\\nand for balance sizes of 600 mm and 800 mm diameter is\\r\\nlikely to be received shortly.\\r\\n42 n THE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED\\r\\nThe company introduced 195 nos. of variety of Injection\\r\\nMoulded Pipe fittings during 2017-18. They all have been well\\r\\nreceived in the market. The sale of moulded fittings increased\\r\\nby 6% in volume terms during the year under review. The\\r\\nCompany has plan of introducing further new items during\\r\\nthe year as per system requirement.\\r\\nThe Company manufactures the cPVC Pipes at three of\\r\\nits manufacturing location and cPVC Fittings at two of its\\r\\nmanufacturing locations. The Company has planned further\\r\\nexpansion of CPVC System manufacturing at it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s existing plants.\\r\\nThe total product portfolio in Pipe System has reached 7730\\r\\nnos., thus adding 500 products to the range of various Plastic\\r\\nPiping System.\\r\\nThe AQUAKRAFT Bath Fittings introduced by the company\\r\\nis well established now including newly launched Chrome\\r\\nPlated range. There were 11 new items introduced during the\\r\\nyear. The portfolio in Bath Fittings has reached to 100 items.\\r\\nFor test market, Company also imported 16 variety of Bath\\r\\nFittings to service local market. The Company plans to further\\r\\ncomplement the range during 2018-19 by introducing large\\r\\nvarieties of products in Bath fittings.\\r\\nThe Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business to Export market during the year saw\\r\\na growth of 48% in US $ terms. The company is continuously\\r\\ntrying to boost its export business of Piping Systems.\\r\\nThe Division\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Value Added Products sale was 31.76%. The\\r\\ncompany has also added further 68 direct business Channel\\r\\npartners during the year taking the total to 984 Nos.. The\\r\\nCompany continues to expand its reach by appointing\\r\\nDistributors in areas where there is a gap. The company has\\r\\nalso started directly servicing retailers in selected markets.\\r\\nThe Company has now multiple Knowledge Centres across\\r\\nthe country to facilitate the services locally. At Gadegaon for\\r\\nthe customers of Western India, at Kochi for the customers of\\r\\nSouthern India, at Malanpur for customers of Northern India\\r\\nand at Kharagpur for customers of Eastern India.\\r\\nAlthough Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s CPVC Fire Sprinkler System is approved\\r\\nby Bureau of Indian Standard (BIS) and is also Underwriters\\r\\nLaboratories (UL) listed, still the Company needs product\\r\\napproval to install in Residential /Commercial Buildings.\\r\\nThere is no single authority to approve the product and every\\r\\nState Government has their own rules and regulations to be\\r\\nfollowed in their States. Certain states got Central Authority\\r\\ncalled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDirector Fire Services\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the approval is acceptable\\r\\nto all the Fire Officers and Fire stations within their States.\\r\\nBut in certain States the Company has to seek approval from\\r\\nevery Chief Fire Officer of a city which has status of Municipal\\r\\nCorpor\n",
      "Print --->ation. Seeking approval is a time consuming process.\\r\\nThus the growth in this segment will be slow though it is\\r\\ninternationally proven a better system than metal Fire Sprinkler\\r\\nSystem for Horizontal Application.\\r\\nThe BIS has not yet published the standard for CPVC Fire\\r\\nSprinkler Fittings and also many amendments to IS- 15105,\\r\\nwhich is a standard for design and installation of Fire Sprinkler\\r\\nSystem. Although National Building Code 2016 has been\\r\\npublished the implementation part has still not gathered pace.\\r\\nAs a result the awareness about mandatory installation of CPVC\\r\\nFire Sprinkler System in High-rise Residential Apartments as\\r\\nwell as Commercial buildings is not catching the momentum.\\r\\nThe Company is putting lot of efforts in creating awareness\\r\\nabout it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s products by meeting various Developers, Consultants\\r\\nand Installers in all the major Metropolitan and Tier-I cities. As\\r\\na result of these efforts the Company could install this system\\r\\nat Mumbai, Pune and Goa locations for many upcoming Highrise\\r\\nBuildings. These installations will work as a showcase to\\r\\npresent it to future buyers, consultants and installers.\\r\\nThe installers who did the mock-up installations are truly\\r\\nsatisfied. They see tremendous benefit because of ease and\\r\\nspeed of installation while using this product. They have\\r\\nconfirmed that the speed of installation is four times faster\\r\\nthan the earlier metal installations and the skill requirement\\r\\nis less as no welding or threading operations are involved.\\r\\nThe Company has developed moulds for fast running fittings\\r\\nand the samples are already under testing with Underwriters\\r\\nLaboratories (UL). This will enhance Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s efficiency in\\r\\ndelivering the products to the end users with speed.\\r\\nThe Company has started participating in various \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFire and\\r\\nSafety\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Exhibitions in India as well as abroad as part of\\r\\npromotional activities. This is helping in creating awareness to\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Supreme Flameguard\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Brand . The Company is getting good\\r\\nresponse from Indian as well as Overseas buyers.\\r\\nApart from installation in India the Company has supplied it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nproducts to a hotel project in Sri Lanka and to a renowned\\r\\ndistributor in Philippines.\\r\\nThe Company expects that most of the regulatory approvals\\r\\nwill be over and indigenous development of products should\\r\\nbe complete during the current Calendar year. The business\\r\\nmay catch momentum from the second half of the current\\r\\nfinancial year.\\r\\nTo support environment concern the Company is gearing up\\r\\nto meet with National Green Tribunal and court directive of\\r\\nphasing out Lead stabilizers from manufacturing of different\\r\\ntypes of u PVC Pipes. The Company is planning a phased\\r\\nout schedule for different variety of PVC Pipes having Lead\\r\\nstabilizers to produce with Lead free stabilizers.\\r\\n4.2 Consumer Products\\r\\n4.2.1 FURNITURE\\r\\nThe business during the year had a good growth.

      "b'Management Discussion and Analysis\\r\\n1. OVERVIEW\\r\\nThere were far reaching structural reforms implemented in the\\r\\nIndian economy in the last seventeen months starting from\\r\\nNovember 2016. In the process these measures have put the\\r\\neconomy on sound growth path. They augur well to put the\\r\\neconomy in high growth mode in future.\\r\\nThe most significant reform was introduction of Goods and\\r\\nService Tax w.e.f 1.7.2017. This single measure has integrated\\r\\nthe Country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economy. Overall, the incidence of indirect tax\\r\\nhas come down on most of the products by this measure of\\r\\nmerging several indirect taxes and cess charged on the products\\r\\nin different States prior to July 2017.\\r\\nThe streamlining of GST implementation and Tax rates took\\r\\nsome time. That has created upheaval in 1st half of last year.\\r\\nFor your Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business, the introduction of Realty\\r\\nEstate regulation Act (RERA) has also affected growth of piping\\r\\nbusiness in Housing Sector for several months.\\r\\nThe several initiatives taken by Government to boost rural\\r\\nincome and infrastructure are now fructifying to boost business\\r\\nin several segments which are catered by the Company . The\\r\\nCompany, therefore, envisaged a faster growth in business\\r\\nfrom April 2018 and beyond. On the basis of the promising\\r\\nfuture demand growth, the Company started committing larger\\r\\ninvestments during the year than planned at beginning of the\\r\\nyear.\\r\\nDue to hardening of Polymer Prices and lack of new capacity\\r\\nbuild up of the PVC resin all around the world, the PVC\\r\\nprices have moved to higher band. For the year 2018-19, it is\\r\\nexpected that the PVC price trend will remain on higher side.\\r\\nIn spite of increase in Crude prices, the prices of Polythene\\r\\nwill move to a lower level over the year as several new plants\\r\\nare starting in USA based on the low feed stock cost of Shale\\r\\ngas. Overall, the polymer prices will remain affordable.\\r\\nThe effect of Demonetization , GST and RERA looks to have\\r\\nsettled down to a large extent. The economy is moving to\\r\\nformal sector slowly, but surely from informal sector. This\\r\\naugurs well to boost the economic activity in the Country. The\\r\\ninitial forecast for Monsoon this year is also normal. Company,\\r\\ntherefore, expects business conditions to be favorable in the\\r\\nyear to boost the demand for it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s products.\\r\\nThe Company expects to put two new Greenfield plants\\r\\nin production this year \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one at Telangana and another at\\r\\nRajasthan. The Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s additional construction of buildings\\r\\nin existing plants and start up of production at those sites will\\r\\nalso go in production this year at Malanpur, Khopoli, Hosur\\r\\nand Kharagpur.\\r\\nThe Company intends to start two new plants at Andhra\\r\\nPradesh and Assam. Land acquisition process has started. They\\r\\nmay partially go into production next year.\\r\\nThe Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s units to make up automobile products at\\r\\nKhuskhera has been put in JV with a Japanese Company. The\\r\\nCompany may divest it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s small holding in that Unit within 2-3\\r\\nyears after start up of this J.V\\r\\n2. PRODUCT GROUPS\\r\\nThe product groups of the Company have been recast as\\r\\nfollows:\\r\\nGroup Products\\r\\nPlastics\\r\\nPiping\\r\\nSystem\\r\\nuPVC Pipes, Injection Moulded PVC fittings and\\r\\nhandmade fittings, Polypropylene Random Copolymer\\r\\npipe system, HDPE Pipe Systems, CPVC Pipes\\r\\nSystems, Inspection\n",

COMPANY\\xe2\\x80\\x99S STRENGTH AND GROWTH DRIVERS\\r\\n3.1 M anufacturing Sites\\r\\nThe Company is operating from 25 manufacturing sites\\r\\noperating in 11States and Union Territories. The Company\\r\\nintends to start working on two new sites to put up plant in the\\r\\ncurrent year. It is expected that the Company will be finalizing\\r\\nthe location in Andhra Pradesh and Assam during this year and\\r\\nstart activities to put up the plants.\\r\\n3.2 Distribution network\\r\\nYour Company is committed to increase its reach throughout\\r\\nthe country. To attain this objective, the Company has added\\r\\nfurther distributors in the past year. The distributors strength\\r\\nhas gone up to 3303.Nos by the end of March 2018 compared\\r\\nto 2973 nos by March 2017.\\r\\nWherever the Company could not find suitable distributors\\r\\nto buy and stock Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s products for re-distribution\\r\\nthroughout the retail chain of that area, the Company started\\r\\nselling products directly to big retailers in that area. Selectively,\\r\\nthe Company has strengthened it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supply system to service\\r\\nthose retailers in a cost efficient manner. The Company started\\r\\nthis only very selectively.\\r\\nYour Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Supreme brand is now registered with a\\r\\npunch line \\xe2\\x80\\x9c Supreme \\xe2\\x80\\x93 People who know plastics best.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n3.3 Growth Drivers\\r\\nYour Company is strengthening its brand in Two ways. One by\\r\\nincreasing expenditure on Advertisement through Electronic,\\r\\nPrint media and participating in several Exhibitions in India\\r\\nand abroad along with large meets of plumbers, Dealers,\\r\\nRetailers and\n",
      " Architects. The Company participated in several\\r\\nexhibitions in India and internationally last year. Secondly\\r\\nCompany is taking legal recourse to contain counterfeit\\r\\nproducts in Plastics pipe System, XF Products and Furniture.\\r\\nCompany assiduously works to address this menace.\\r\\n4. OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE\\r\\n4.1 Plastics Piping Systems\\r\\nThe Company continues its objective to grow in Plastic Pipe\\r\\nSystem business. The company is leader in this segment as it has\\r\\nthe largest portfolio of products, which is being continuously\\r\\nincreased, to offer more systems as required in the economy.\\r\\nThe introduction of GST regime in the country augured well\\r\\nfor growth of this business. There is likelihood of shift in\\r\\nbusiness from unorganized players to organized players over\\r\\nthe period. This is expected to lead to growth in the business\\r\\nof your Company in forthcoming years.\\r\\nThe Company during the year under review registered an over\\r\\nall revenue growth of 10% in Plastic Piping System made from\\r\\ndifferent plastic materials. Overall the company sold 2,56,330\\r\\nTons of Pipe System compared to 2,35,256 Tons in same period\\r\\nof last year.\\r\\nThe growth in the business was not upto Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nexpectation. GST introduction has put damper in Agri market\\r\\nrequirement in April/June. Real Estate Regulation Act (RERA)\\r\\nto regulate the Housing Sector has slowed down the demand\\r\\nfrom this sector for quite a period.\\r\\nThe Government at the Centre and States has put the priority\\r\\nfocus on Swatch Bharat Abhiyan, Sanitation and affordable\\r\\nhouses to all and development of 100 smart cities on all\\r\\nIndia basis. Real Estate Regulation Act (RERA) has created a\\r\\nmajor transformation the way housing construction for sale\\r\\nwas in vogue in the Country. It affected the business growth\\r\\nin Housing in the year under review. The growth tempo has\\r\\nnow started and the Company expects good demand coming\\r\\nfrom this segment in this year.\\r\\nThe Company incurred Capex of R 144 crore in this year in it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nvarious plants to build more capacities and increase product\\r\\nrange. Majority of them has been put to use .\\r\\nThe Company with objective of making its footprint for\\r\\nmanufacturing at South Zone, for Plastic Piping Division,\\r\\nhas got 50 acres of land allotted at Jadcherla-District\\r\\nMahaboobnagar at Telangana. The civil construction work\\r\\nhas started and production of Water & Septic Tanks is likely to\\r\\nstart in October/December \\xe2\\x80\\x992018. The Company will launch\\r\\nother Piping System products at this location in next one/ two\\r\\nyear. The Company has entered into a MOU with the State\\r\\nGovernment of Andhra Government to put up a project at\\r\\nNellore district. Efforts are being made to acquire the required\\r\\nland of approx. 40 acres to start the manufacturing there. The\\r\\nCompany aims to start production at the same site in second\\r\\nhalf of 2019-2020.\\r\\nThe plant at Kharagpur is fully operational. The capacity\\r\\nincrease for PVC,HDPE & CPVC Pipes is now in place and\\r\\nbecome operational. The Company is also exploring further\\r\\nincreasing the capacity of HDPE Pipe at Kharagpur plant to\\r\\ncater to increased demand.\\r\\nTo meet the increasing demand of HDPE Pipes in North India,\\r\\nthe Company has taken in hand to put up the capacity in\\r\\nMalanpur Unit No.3. The same will go in production in July/\\r\\nSeptember 2018 quarter.\\r\\nAnother Roto Moulding plant is now operation\n",
      "al at Kharagpur.\\r\\nThe enhanced capacity at Gadegaon facility for Roto Moulded\\r\\nProducts is made operational. The capacity of Roto Moulded\\r\\nProducts is being planned to increase at Malanpur and Kanpur\\r\\nplant.\\r\\nThe production of Double Wall Corrugated HDPE Pipes\\r\\nhas started from Gadegaon plant with BIS Certification. The\\r\\ncompany has also started commercial production of Double\\r\\nWall Corrugated HDPE Pipes at Kharagpur. At Kharagpur the\\r\\nBIS certification for Pipes up to diameter of 500 mm is received\\r\\nand for balance sizes of 600 mm and 800 mm diameter is\\r\\nlikely to be received shortly.\\r\\n42 n THE SUPREME INDUSTRIES LIMITED\\r\\nThe company introduced 195 nos. of variety of Injection\\r\\nMoulded Pipe fittings during 2017-18. They all have been well\\r\\nreceived in the market. The sale of moulded fittings increased\\r\\nby 6% in volume terms during the year under review. The\\r\\nCompany has plan of introducing further new items during\\r\\nthe year as per system requirement.\\r\\nThe Company manufactures the cPVC Pipes at three of\\r\\nits manufacturing location and cPVC Fittings at two of its\\r\\nmanufacturing locations. The Company has planned further\\r\\nexpansion of CPVC System manufacturing at it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s existing plants.\\r\\nThe total product portfolio in Pipe System has reached 7730\\r\\nnos., thus adding 500 products to the range of various Plastic\\r\\nPiping System.\\r\\nThe AQUAKRAFT Bath Fittings introduced by the company\\r\\nis well established now including newly launched Chrome\\r\\nPlated range. There were 11 new items introduced during the\\r\\nyear. The portfolio in Bath Fittings has reached to 100 items.\\r\\nFor test market, Company also imported 16 variety of Bath\\r\\nFittings to service local market. The Company plans to further\\r\\ncomplement the range during 2018-19 by introducing large\\r\\nvarieties of products in Bath fittings.\\r\\nThe Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business to Export market during the year saw\\r\\na growth of 48% in US $ terms. The company is continuously\\r\\ntrying to boost its export business of Piping Systems.\\r\\nThe Division\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Value Added Products sale was 31.76%. The\\r\\ncompany has also added further 68 direct business Channel\\r\\npartners during the year taking the total to 984 Nos.. The\\r\\nCompany continues to expand its reach by appointing\\r\\nDistributors in areas where there is a gap. The company has\\r\\nalso started directly servicing retailers in selected markets.\\r\\nThe Company has now multiple Knowledge Centres across\\r\\nthe country to facilitate the services locally. At Gadegaon for\\r\\nthe customers of Western India, at Kochi for the customers of\\r\\nSouthern India, at Malanpur for customers of Northern India\\r\\nand at Kharagpur for customers of Eastern India.\\r\\nAlthough Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s CPVC Fire Sprinkler System is approved\\r\\nby Bureau of Indian Standard (BIS) and is also Underwriters\\r\\nLaboratories (UL) listed, still the Company needs product\\r\\napproval to install in Residential /Commercial Buildings.\\r\\nThere is no single authority to approve the product and every\\r\\nState Government has their own rules and regulations to be\\r\\nfollowed in their States. Certain states got Central Authority\\r\\ncalled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDirector Fire Services\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the approval is acceptable\\r\\nto all the Fire Officers and Fire stations within their States.\\r\\nBut in certain States the Company has to seek approval from\\r\\nevery Chief Fire Officer of a city which has status of Municipal\\r\\nCorpor\n",
      "ation. Seeking approval is a time consuming process.\\r\\nThus the growth in this segment will be slow though it is\\r\\ninternationally proven a better system than metal Fire Sprinkler\\r\\nSystem for Horizontal Application.\\r\\nThe BIS has not yet published the standard for CPVC Fire\\r\\nSprinkler Fittings and also many amendments to IS- 15105,\\r\\nwhich is a standard for design and installation of Fire Sprinkler\\r\\nSystem. Although National Building Code 2016 has been\\r\\npublished the implementation part has still not gathered pace.\\r\\nAs a result the awareness about mandatory installation of CPVC\\r\\nFire Sprinkler System in High-rise Residential Apartments as\\r\\nwell as Commercial buildings is not catching the momentum.\\r\\nThe Company is putting lot of efforts in creating awareness\\r\\nabout it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s products by meeting various Developers, Consultants\\r\\nand Installers in all the major Metropolitan and Tier-I cities. As\\r\\na result of these efforts the Company could install this system\\r\\nat Mumbai, Pune and Goa locations for many upcoming Highrise\\r\\nBuildings. These installations will work as a showcase to\\r\\npresent it to future buyers, consultants and installers.\\r\\nThe installers who did the mock-up installations are truly\\r\\nsatisfied. They see tremendous benefit because of ease and\\r\\nspeed of installation while using this product. They have\\r\\nconfirmed that the speed of installation is four times faster\\r\\nthan the earlier metal installations and the skill requirement\\r\\nis less as no welding or threading operations are involved.\\r\\nThe Company has developed moulds for fast running fittings\\r\\nand the samples are already under testing with Underwriters\\r\\nLaboratories (UL). This will enhance Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s efficiency in\\r\\ndelivering the products to the end users with speed.\\r\\nThe Company has started participating in various \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFire and\\r\\nSafety\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Exhibitions in India as well as abroad as part of\\r\\npromotional activities. This is helping in creating awareness to\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Supreme Flameguard\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Brand . The Company is getting good\\r\\nresponse from Indian as well as Overseas buyers.\\r\\nApart from installation in India the Company has supplied it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nproducts to a hotel project in Sri Lanka and to a renowned\\r\\ndistributor in Philippines.\\r\\nThe Company expects that most of the regulatory approvals\\r\\nwill be over and indigenous development of products should\\r\\nbe complete during the current Calendar year. The business\\r\\nmay catch momentum from the second half of the current\\r\\nfinancial year.\\r\\nTo support environment concern the Company is gearing up\\r\\nto meet with National Green Tribunal and court directive of\\r\\nphasing out Lead stabilizers from manufacturing of different\\r\\ntypes of u PVC Pipes. The Company is planning a phased\\r\\nout schedule for different variety of PVC Pipes having Lead\\r\\nstabilizers to produce with Lead free stabilizers.\\r\\n4.2 Consumer Products\\r\\n4.2.1 FURNITURE\\r\\nThe business during the year had a good growth. The company\\r\\ngrew by 11 % on value terms and 8 % on volume terms where\\r\\nas the overall Plastic Furniture Industry grew by only 4 % on\\r\\nvalue terms. The company faced initial hiccups in business with\\r\\nGST regime.

Several new players have also entered this business\\r\\nin the country claiming to make similar products like our\\r\\nCompany. Combination of these two factors have affected the\\r\\nvolume & margins in this segment of business.\\r\\nPrior to launch of GST on 1st July, 2017 there was lot of\\r\\nconfusion, particularly amongst the traders, regarding eligibility\\r\\nof credit of duties paid on purchase of goods which remained\\r\\nin stock on the date of GST implementation. Most of the\\r\\ncompany\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dealers curtailed purchases to maintain stocks at\\r\\na very low level. This adversely impacted sale of company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nproducts during the first quarter of the year which are supposed\\r\\nto be the peak months for the sale of tarpaulins. In the GST\\r\\nregime, the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s main product tarpaulin was placed\\r\\ninitially in the highest rate bracket i.e. 28%. This made the\\r\\nproduct costly to the end users. After lot of representations\\r\\nat various forums the GST rate on tarpaulin was reduced\\r\\nfrom 28% to 18% but in the meantime company lost sizeable\\r\\nbusiness. Though the sales picked up from September\\r\\nonwards, the loss of sales during the first five months \n",

The company is working on\\r\\ndeveloping specialized new applications to increase the size\\r\\nof market. The company aims to bringing in new customers\\r\\nin its fold in the existing markets & reaching out new markets\\r\\nwhere at present it does not have any presence by show casing\\r\\nits products in various international exhibitions.\\r\\nWith enhanced capacity at its disposal the company has made\\r\\nCross Line (XL) Bonded Film available in almost all thicknesses.\\r\\nThis product has superior properties than the normal XF Film\\r\\n& enjoys patent protection. The company has now acquired\\r\\nall the rights in the patents of Cross Line Bonded Film from\\r\\nthe technical collaborator. This will bring in lot of savings in\\r\\nthe royalties in the coming years as the sale of this product is\\r\\nexpected to grow.\\r\\nIn the coming year the thrust will be on developing newer\\r\\napplications and entering into several international markets.\\r\\nThe company has developed many new fabricated products\\r\\napart from Tarpaulin. Due to its superior properties it is\\r\\ngetting increased acceptance in different applications.
