Francisco Getúlio Vargas 1130, Petrópolis, CEP: 95070-560, \\nCaxias do Sul, RS, Brasil. E-mail: efreire@ucs.br\\n\\nApplications of PVC in Industry \\nIn terms of revenue generated, PVC is one of the most \\nvaluable products of the chemical industry. Globally, over \\n50% of PVC manufactured is used in construction. As a \\nbuilding material, PVC is cheap and easy to assemble. In \\nrecent years, PVC has been replacing traditional building \\nmaterials such as wood, concrete and clay in many areas. \\nDespite claims that PVC production negatively affects the \\nnatural environment and human health, it is still widely \\nused\\n[4]\\n.\\nThere are many uses for PVC. As a rigid plastic, it is \\nused as vinyl siding, magnetic stripe cards, window pro˜\\n-\\nle, pipe, plumbing and conduit ˜xtures. PVC is common\\n-\\nly used as the insulation on electric wires\\n[5]\\n. Frequently in \\napplications where smoke is a major hazard (notably in \\ntunnels) PVC-free LSOH (low-smoke, zero-halogen) cable \\ninsulation is used. \\nIn ˚at sheet form, polyvinyl chloride is often expanded \\nto create voids in the material, providing additional thick\\n-\\nness without additional weight. These sheets and ˜lms are \\nused to produce a wide variety of commercial signage pro\\n-\\nducts. The unplasticized polyvinyl chloride (uPVC) is being \\nused in the building industry as a low maintenance material, \\nparticularly in the UK and in the USA, where it is known \\nas vinyl. The same material has almost entirely replaced the \\nuse of cast iron for plumbing and drainage, being used for \\nwaste pipes, drainpipes, gutters and down pipes\\n[5]\\n.\\nThe recycling of PVC can be performed in different \\nways. Some PVC manufacturers have vinyl recycling pro\\n-\\ngrams, recycling both manufacturing waste back into their \\nproducts, as well as post consumer PVC construction ma\\n-\\nterials to reduce the load on land˜lls. Another alternative to \\nIntroduction\\nWorldwide, extruder lines are the largest converters of \\nplastics and can be considered the most important produc\\n-\\ntion machinery in the plastic industry. Commercially, ex\\n-\\ntrusion lines are target to give advantages with regard to \\noperating cost (output per hour). It is possible to produce \\nthroughout extrusion ˜lms, sheets, pro˜les, pipes, tubes, \\nrods, wire coverings, coatings, ˜laments, blown shapes \\nand many others. Pipes are one of the most important parts \\nmade by extrusion, and it has a wide range of applications, \\nespecially in the industry. The two main reasons that make \\nthem attractive to the processors and markets are their al\\n-\\nmost unlimited range of applications and their continuous \\nproduction capabilities to meet new market challenges\\n[1]\\n.\\nThe production of thermoplastic pipe systems is a major \\nindustry which accounts for a signi˜cant volume of poly\\n-\\nmers. Use of plastics materials by the building industry re\\n-\\npresents the second largest worldwide market for polymers. \\nFor pipe production this amount to a total market demands \\nof nearly 3 million tons in Europe for 2000™s\\n[2]\\n.\\nPlastic pipes started commercial production during the \\nlate 1930™s. There are different de˜nitions that are usually \\nassociated with the different industries (plumbing, gas \\ntransmission lines, beverages, medical, mining, etc.). The \\nmost known and acceptable is that pipe is a rigid, hollow, \\nlong and larger piece in diameter than tubes\\n[1]\\n. Tubings are \\nbasically the same except they are ˚exible and smaller in \\ndiameter with thin walls up to 6 in\\n[3]\\n. \\nThis paper covers the production of PVC pipes made \\nby extrusion, a market study and the machinery and equip\\n-\\nments needed for a PVC extrusion line. \\nApplications and Market of PVC for Piping Industry\\nJohnny De N. Martins, Estevão Freire\\nDepartamento de Engenharia Química, UCS\\nHenry Hemadipour\\nKansas Technology Center, Pittsburg State University, USA\\nAbstract: \\nThe use of plastic materials by the piping industry accounts for a signi˜cant volume of polymers. In this segment \\nPVC represents the largest worldwide market for plastics. PVC is often used in plastic pressure pipe systems for pipelines \\nin the water and sewer industries because of its inexpensive nature and ˚exibility. Pipes and ˜ttings constitute the largest \\nvolume application at 40% of the marketplace. This paper discusses the piping extrusion process and the worldwide PVC \\nmarket, emphasizing the Brazilian market. It is also presented a case study including an overall cost calculation for making \\nan extrusion line for PVC piping. \\nKeywords: \\nPVC, piping industry, market, extrusion process.\\n', 'Martins, J. N. et al. -\\n Applications and market of PVC for piping industry\\nPolímeros: Ciência e Tecnologia, vol. 19, nº 1, p. 58-62, 2009\\n \\n59\\nOther polymers\\nVinyl polymers and ABS does not show dif˜cult to melt, \\nhaving properties superior to the pipe material when proper \\nbonding procedure are used\\n[1]\\n. HDPE is used in various ap\\n-\\nplications, such as pressurized gas and water pipelines that \\nrequire high mechanical strength. Polyethylene requires ope\\n-\\nration at the lowest possible melt temperatures while main\\n-\\ntaining a high level of thermal-mechanical homogeneity in \\nthe melt\\n[1]\\n. Polyamide is extruded at a low melt temperature \\nas possible to provide suf˜cient melt viscosity and to mini\\n-\\nmize thermal degradation; this makes polyamide dif˜cult to \\nprocess and add additional costs to the production\\n[1]\\n. \\nThermoplastic polyesters can provide toughness, ˚exibi\\n-\\nlity, and low temperature properties to the pipes. The control \\nof the melt temperature is important; if too high it can reduce \\nthe melt strength signi˜cantly, the result will be a irregular \\nwall thickness. If the temperature is too low, it can result in a \\npoor tube ˜nishing, uneven dimensions, and weld lines. This \\ntemperature control also means dif˜culty of production and \\nelevated costs in machinery and auxiliary equipments\\n[1]\\n.\\nUHMWPE can be used when traditional plastics resins \\nare unable to meet performance requirements. Their signi˜\\n-\\ncant properties include exceptional high chemical resistance, \\ncorrosion resistance, environmental stress crack resistance, \\nand abrasion resistance. However this material has high costs \\nand need an extensive process conditions control\\n[1]\\n.\\nPipes Extrusion Process\\nPipe is a tube or hollow cylinder for the conveyance of \\n˚uid. The terms ﬁpipeﬂ and ﬁtubingﬂ are almost interchan\\n-\\ngeable. ﬁTubeﬂ is often made to custom sizes and may have \\nmore speci˜c sizes and tolerances than pipe, depending on \\nthe application. The term ﬁtubingﬂ can also be applied to \\ntubes of a non-cylindrical nature (i.e. square tubing). The \\nterm ﬁtubingﬂ is more widely used in the USA and ﬁpipeﬂ \\nelsewhere in the world\\n[10]\\n.\\nPipe may be speci˜ed by standard pipe size designations, \\nsuch as Nominal Pipe Size (in the US), or by nominal, out\\n-\\nside, or inside diameter and wall thickness. Many industrial \\nand government standards exist for the production of pipe \\nand tubing\\n[11]\\n.\\nMost pipes are made through extrusion, in-line with \\nthe direction of extrusion, die, sizing or calibrating device \\nor tank, water cooling tank, conveyor, and cutter, if needed, \\nand take off equipment at the end of the line. The line could \\ninclude a marking device or a testing device. An important \\nrequirement is to cool the extrudate rather fast near the die \\nwhile keeping control of dimensions and properties\\n[7]\\n.\\nIncluded in the processes are various techniques to control \\nthe dimensions/sizes that are either free drawn melts (usually \\nfor the small diameter tubes) or sizing features. The total cost \\nof producing the pipe could include material costs of up to \\n80%. The goal is always to get a tighter tolerance control to \\nthe land˜ll are incineration, however the incineration of PVC \\ngenerate air pollutants such as HCl and dioxine\\n[6]\\n. \\n \\n\\nTable 1 \\nshows the most common properties of the rigid PVC. \\nMaterial Choice for Piping\\nThe choice for a given material to use in piping is limited \\nby performance, installation, and maintenance requirements, \\nas well as by the availability of ˜ttings. For applications re\\n-\\nquiring maximum joint strength and chemical resistance \\nmost thermoplastics can be used, but ˜rst they have to pass \\nby a bonding process\\n[1]\\n.\\nPVC\\nThe most used plastic for application in extrusion is PVC. \\nPVC dry blends allow the processor to take advantages of \\nusing their own compounding formulations that should pro\\n-\\nvide costs advantages\\n[7]\\n. \\nReferring to U.S market, the material is often used in plas\\n-\\ntic pressure pipe systems for pipelines in the water and sewer \\nindustries because of its inexpensive nature and ˚exibility. \\nPVC pipe plumbing is typically white, as opposed to ABS, \\nwhich is commonly available in grey as well as white\\n[8]\\n.\\nPolyvinyl chloride is widely used for producing pipes. \\nIn the water distribution market it accounts for 66 percent \\nof the market in the US, and in sanitary sewer pipe appli\\n-\\ncations, it accounts for 75 percent. In February 2007, the \\n \\n\\nCalifornia Building Standards Code was updated to approve \\nthe use of chlorinated polyvinyl chloride (CPVC) pipe for \\nuse in residential water supply piping systems. CPVC has \\nbeen a nationally accepted material in the US since 1982; ho\\n-\\nwever, California has only permitted its use on a limited ba\\n-\\nsis since 2001. The Department of Housing and Community \\n \\n\\nDevelopment prepared and certi˜ed an Environmental Impact \\nReport resulting in a recommendation that the Commission \\nadopt and approve the use of CPVC. The Commission™s vote \\nwas unanimous and CPVC was placed in the 2007 \\n \\n\\nCalifornia \\nPlumbing Code\\n[9]\\n.\\nTable 1. \\nGeneral properties of the rigid PVC\\n[7]\\n.\\nProperty\\nValue\\nDensity\\n1380 kg/m\\n3\\nYoung™s modulus \\n2900-3300 MPa\\nTensile strength \\n50-80 MPa\\nElongation @ break\\n20-40%\\nImpact strengtht\\n2-5 kJ/m²\\nGlass temperature\\n87 °C\\nMelting point\\n212 °C\\nVicat temperature\\n85 °C\\nHeat transfer coef˜cient \\n0.16 W/m.K\\nLinear expansion coef˜cient\\n8.10\\n-5\\n /K\\nSpeci˜c heat \\n0.9 kJ/(kg·K)\\nWater absorption \\n0.04-0.4\\n', 'Martins, J.

Rapidly ˚uctuating polymer prices and pressure on \\nprices from the consumer end have led to an unstable envi\\n-\\nronment with producer margins being eroded. Many years of \\nrecession, notably in the construction industry, have slowed \\nthe development of the market which is plagued with overca\\n-\\npacity. The structure of the industry has thus been subject to \\nconsiderable change and upheaval in recent years\\n[2]\\n.\\nTwenty per cent of all the resin sold in the world today, \\nconsists of PVC. It is the second most used plastics mate\\n-\\nrial in the world\\n[12]\\n. The PVC global market size in 2007 was \\naround 32.2 million tonnes, and the forecast for 2011 is about \\n39 million tonnes according researched data\\n[12]\\n. The largest \\nworldwide consumption market in 2007 was mainly due to \\nU.S. and Canada, responsible for 25% of all PVC resin con\\n-\\nsumption in the world, while Brazilian market was respon\\n-\\nsible only for 2% of worldwide consumption\\n[13]\\n. Pipes and \\n˜ttings constitute the largest volume application at 40% of \\nthe global market with pro˜les at 17%\\n[2]\\n.\\nThe PVC consumption per capita in 2006 in Brazil \\nwas about 4 kg/habitant, a low consumption when com\\n-\\npared to North American consumption that was about \\n15 kg/habitant\\n[13]\\n. \\nAfter many years of stagnation, Brazilian PVC market \\nfaces a very good moment, especially due to building and \\nconstruction industry. The credit for housing was increased \\nby Brazilian Government from $ 2,5 billion to $ 5,1\\n \\nbillion \\nin order to reduce the housing de˜cit, 350,000 houses were \\nreduce material consumption. Dimensional and/or thickness \\ncalibrating disks of different designs are used.\\n A combination of the melt properties, rate of the line spe\\n-\\ned, internal air pressure, and rate of cooling in˚uences the \\nsize of the tube. The melt drawdown ratio from the die into \\nthe water cooling trough is directly related to the ˜nal size of \\nthe tube. Depending on the plastics being processed, the ratio \\nranges from 4/1 to 10/1. Using low ratios helps to minimize \\nextruded-in stresses, which can lead to problems related to \\nshrinking and stress cracking\\n[7]\\n.\\nDepending on the characteristics of the plastics being \\nprocessed, shrinkage can occur within 24 hours period after \\nleaving the processing line. The tube or pipe may also be \\nsubjected to annealing and other post conditions that could \\naffect the degree of shrinkage.\\nThere are many different ways pipe and tube products used \\nin moving liquids, gases, solids, and so forth. They can be sha\\n-\\nped to provide decorations, safety supports, and so on\\n[7]\\n.\\nSteps to reduce the cost to process plastic pipes include:\\n1) Operate to minimize outer diameter (OD) and internal \\ndiameter (ID) tolerances;\\n2) Improve in pipe quality and properties via studying \\ngains with compounding ingredients and blending \\nprocedures used;\\n3) Reduce set-up time by means of start-up aids and au\\n-\\ntomation systems;\\n4) Develop savings in electricity consumption by the op\\n-\\ntimization of the extruder; and\\n5) Use of ef˜cient dies, cooling tanks, pullers, and take-\\noff equipment.\\nThe tolerance control of pullers is critical to minimizing \\nOD and ID dimensions, particularly the smaller tube sizes. \\nA very slight variation in the puller speed can drastically in\\n-\\n˚uence their dimensions and waste of plastics.\\nTable 2. \\nCommon troubleshooting in pipe extrusion\\n[1]\\n.\\nProblem\\nCause\\nSolution\\nWavy inside surface\\nMelt temperature too low\\nLow lubricant level\\nPulsating drawdown\\nIncrease set temperatures\\nCorrect formulation\\nCheck caterpillar\\nExcessive extrude thickness\\nInadequate die gap\\nInadequate operating conditions\\nAdjust or replace die\\nAdjust melt temperatures\\nLine, streaks and foreign specks\\nDirty die\\nScratched die lips\\nDrag plug too close to die\\nExcessive melt temperature\\nContaminated melt ˚ow\\nClean die\\nRepair die \\nCorrect drag-plug location\\nReduce set temperatures\\nCheck compound\\nSharkskin, melt fracture\\nMelt temperature too low\\nFriction at the die lips\\nIncrease the die lips temperature\\nRepair die lips coating\\nModify formulation\\nExtrudate velocity with a transversal component\\nUnbalanced exit ˚ow\\nTemperature ˚uctuations in die\\nDirty die\\nModify die land geometry\\nCheck heaters and thermocouples\\nCheck set temperatures\\n', 'Martins, J.

The traveling cut-off saw for a typical \\npipe extrusion line can be an automatic traveling cut off saw. \\nThe average cost for this equipment is $ 4,500\\n[16]\\n. Therefore, \\nthe average total cost of auxiliary equipments in an extrusion \\npipe lines is $ 27,500.\\nMaterials\\nThe average price of PVC resin is about $ 0.72 per pound. \\nBut as it is known PVC cannot be processed without use of \\nplasticizers and heat stabilizer\\n[17]\\n. Many additives such as plas\\n-\\nticizers, impact modi˜ers, processing aids, ˜llers, lubricants \\nand stabilizers have a decisive importance for the properties \\nof PVC. It is sometimes dif˜cult to make unplasticized PVC \\n˚ow smoothly through the processing equipment and produ\\n-\\nce homogeneous products\\n[17]\\n. The addition of plasticizers to \\na PVC formulation decreases many mechanical properties of \\nthe PVC product (hardness, tensile strength, modulus, etc.); \\nhowever, low-temperature ˚exibility, elongation, and the ease \\nof processing are all improved\\n[18]\\n. \\nGenerally phthalate, adipate and polymeric plasticizers \\nare used in the formulation of PVC. Usually, the most used \\nplasticizers cost approximately $ 2.00 per pound. A very \\ncommon PVC plasticizer like liquid butyltin carboxylate or \\nBa/Zn liquids alloys has an average cost of approximately \\n$\\n \\n10.00 per pound\\n[19]\\n.\\nConclusions\\nThe production of thermoplastic pipe systems is a major \\nindustry which accounts for a signi˜cant volume of poly\\n-\\nmers. The production of PVC pipes is extremely important \\nto this industry, since PVC pipes is widely used, especially \\nin water pipelines, and this industry will continually growing \\nthroughout the years.\\nThe extrusion process requires some adjustments, mainly \\nin terms of cooling system, die and resin preparation.
